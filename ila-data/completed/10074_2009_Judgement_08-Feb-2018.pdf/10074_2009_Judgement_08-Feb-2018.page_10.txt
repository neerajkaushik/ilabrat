It may not be out of context to note that the determination under Order XXII Rule 5 of CPC is summary in nature and for limited purpose . Order passed on the impleadment applications , determining a particular person as legal representative has no effect of final decision or operates as res-judicata between the legal representatives as to the question of who should ascend as Guru . At the cost of repetition , we may note that the determination by the High Court would be limited to the question , as to who should be brought on record in the place of deceased for the purposes of continuing the suit alone , and nothing beyond that . 13 . In view of the foregoing reasons , we set aside the order of the High Court and remit the matter back to the High Court for determining the issue as per the provisions of Order 22 Rule 5 . The High Court shall decide the question on merits as to who is the legal representative of the deceased Swami Sheo Dharmanand on the basis of the reports submitted by the trial Court and also taking into account any objections or material which the parties rely upon . Only thereafter , the High Court shall proceed with the hearing of second appeal . We request the High Court to take up the matter as early as possible and dispose of the same expeditiously in
