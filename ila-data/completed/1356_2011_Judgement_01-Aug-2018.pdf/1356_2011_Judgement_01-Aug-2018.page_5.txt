nothing prevented the Appellant from making a second assault to ensure his death , rather than to have run away . The intention appears more to have been to teach a lesson by the venting of ire by an irked neighbour , due to loud playing of the tape recorder . But in the nature of weapon used , the assault made in the rib cage area , knowledge that death was likely to ensue will have to be attributed to the Appellant . 8 . In the entirety of the evidence , the facts and circumstances of the case , we are unable to sustain the conviction of the Appellant under Section 302 I.P.C. and are satisfied that it deserves to be altered to Section 304 Part-II I.P.C . It is ordered accordingly . Considering the period of custody undergone after his conviction , we alter the sentence to the period of custody already undergone . The Appellant may be released forthwith if not required in any other case .
