12 decision of the First Appellate Court has _ been rightly reversed by the High Court . The entitlement to obtain ryotwari patta has _ been proved . The claim for conferral of ryotwari patta has not been properly adjudicated by the concerned authorities . Civil suits were maintainable and have been rightly decreed . It was also contended on behalf of plaintiff that difference in the area of the tank has not been properly explained and the area in question is not part of the tank , it was at the periphery of the tank . Thus , there was no bar under the Act of 1908 to give the same on lease to S.Vijayaranga Mudaliar and , as right , title and interest for obtaining of ryotwari patta had accrued to him , he could have alienated the property in the year 1952 . Finding as to possession is also the question of fact and has been rightly arrived at by the Trial Court which has rightly been restored by the High Court . No case for interference is made out . For maintainability of the civil suit , they have relied upon the decision in Dokiseela Ramulu vs. Sri Sangameswara Swamy Varu & Ors .
