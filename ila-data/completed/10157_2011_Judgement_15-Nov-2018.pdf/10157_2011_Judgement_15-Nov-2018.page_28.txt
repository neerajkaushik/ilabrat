28 to set aside the finding of possession recorded by the First Appellate Court and for discarding the B-9 of taking possession in 1951 as that was supported by corresponding revenue entries and statutory presumption of correctness is attached to such entries though such presumption is rebuttable . However , there is absolutely no evidence adduced on record by the plaintiff to rebut the statutory presumption of correctness of document of record of rights . Thus , trial court , as well as the High Court , has acted ina perverse manner in discarding the overwhelming evidence merely on the ground that document A-1 to A-4 stands proved . The High Court could not have inferred in favour of the plaintiff , as no right accrued to the plaintiff or to his predecessor-in-interest on the basis of the aforesaid document A-1 to A-4 . The High Court has unnecessarily drawn adverse inference just in order to give a finding of the genuineness of the document A-1 to A-4 . We take these documents as proved and proceed to deal with the case on that basis .
