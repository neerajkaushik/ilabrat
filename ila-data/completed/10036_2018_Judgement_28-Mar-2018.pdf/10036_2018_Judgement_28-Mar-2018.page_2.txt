5 . It is fairly clear that the petition was withdrawn only on account of the pendency of the appeal . Apparently , that is why the High Court has , in fact , not dismissed the petition ; it has only disposed it of . 6 . In the second writ petition leading to the impugned judgment , there is a specific prayer , which reads as follows : “ ( iii ) quash and set aside the communication dated 3.9.2016 at Annexure-10 issued by respondent No. 5 being violative of principles of natural justice and bad in law ; ” as It appears that the prayer challenging ’ the subsequent order passed in appeal was not brought to the notice of the High Court . 8 . In that view of the matter , the writ petition certainly is maintainable . Accordingly , we set aside the impugned judgment with a request to the High Court to consider Writ Petition No. 484/2017 on merits . 9 . We make it clear that we have not considered the merits of the matter . 10 . The appellant is also directed to serve a copy of this judgment along with a copy of this petition/appeal to the respondents . 11 . The appeal is , accordingly , disposed of .
