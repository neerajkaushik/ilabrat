proceed against them for violation of Regulation 7A of the Brokers Regulations and PFUTP Regulations . Merely because a broker facilitated a transaction , it can not be said that there is violation of the Regulation . SEBI has not provided any material to suggest negligence or connivance on the part of the brokers . As held by this Court in _ Kishore R. Ajmera ( supra ) , there are several factors to be considered . We would especially like to refer to the case of Angel Trading wherein the broker repeatedly wrote to the National Stock Exchange informing them about trades in the options segment that were executed at unrealistic prices and requesting them to put in mechanisms in the Options segment so that these trades are not allowed to enter the system . In the absence of any material provided by SEBI to prove the charges against the brokers , particularly regarding aiding and abetting fraudulent or unfair trade practices , we are of the opinion that the orders of SEBI against the brokers should be interfered with . Accordingly , the appeals filed against the brokers are dismissed . 53
