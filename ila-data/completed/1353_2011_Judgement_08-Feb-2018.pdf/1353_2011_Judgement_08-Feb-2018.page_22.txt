26 . After affording an opportunity for filing reply to the SCNs and a personal hearing , the A.O. passed a detailed order dated 26.03.2009 in the case of Rakhi Trading . Paragraphs 22 to 24 read as follows : “ 22 . \ If the individual trades are seen from the order log provided to the noticee , it is seen that the time difference between the buy and sell order is only in seconds . Most of the orders were matched in a time gap of 1 , 2 or 3 seconds and many orders have matched to the exact second , i.e. time difference is 0 ( zero ) . This is proof enough to establish the existence of synchronization of trades ; otherwise the trades would not have matched repeatedly to the exact second in the NIFTY Contracts which is the most active contract in the options segment . Hence it overrides the noticee ’s submission that no material or data has been disclosed to substantiate the said allegation of “ synchronization ” of any trades . 23 . On analysis of the reversal transactions undertaken by the noticee , it is seen that the percentage to market gross is in the range of 30 percent to 50 percent in the 14 contracts executed by the noticee . In two contracts of NIFTY , the percentage to market gross reached 50 percent . This accounts for a significant percentage of trades on _ the concerned days and the traded value was Rs. 95.75 lakhs for those two reversal trades . The trade quantities are also high . The total traded value is Rs. 503.00 lakh in a matter of just 4 ( four ) trading days . As submitted by the noticee , NIFTY moves constantly . Also , NIFTY is the most active of the options contracts 22
