45 . Before concluding , we would like to reiterate the observations made by this Court in Kishore R. Ajmera ( supra ) and Kanaiyalal Patel ( supra ) regarding the need for a more comprehensive legal framework governing the securities market . As the market grows , ingenuous means of manipulation are also employed . In such a scenario , it is essential that SEBI keeps up with changing times and develops principles for good governance in the stock market which ensure free and fair trading . 46 . There shall be no order as to costs . ( KURIAN JOSEPH ) New Delhi ; February 8 , 2018 . 54
