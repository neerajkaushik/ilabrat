all synchronized transactions are legal and permitted . All synchronized transactions which have the effect of manipulating the market are against fair market practices and hence undesirable and prohibited . ” We have reproduced the observations from the order of the Board only to highlight that the Board also understands that the law is that only such synchronized trades violate the Regulations which manipulate the market . Since the impugned trades of the appellant in the F & O segment had no impact on the market , we hold that they did not violate the Regulations . Shri Kumar Desai learned counsel for the respondent was equally emphatic in arguing that the appellant had not only executed synchronized trades but had also reversed them during the course of the trading with the same counter party and , therefore , the trades were fictitious and non-genuine and that the adjudicating officer was justified in holding so and imposing the monetary penalty for violating the Regulations . He placed strong reliance on the observations of the Tribunal in Ketan Parekh ’s case ( Supra ) wherein it has been held that reversal of trades between the same parties results in fictitious trades and they are illegal . We are unable to agree with him . The observations in Ketan Parekh ’s case were made with reference to the trades that were executed in the cash segment and we are clearly of the view that all those observations can not apply to the trades executed in the F & O segment . Reverse trades in the cash segment have been held to be illegal and violate the Regulations because there is no “ change of beneficial ownership ” in the traded scrip . More 31
