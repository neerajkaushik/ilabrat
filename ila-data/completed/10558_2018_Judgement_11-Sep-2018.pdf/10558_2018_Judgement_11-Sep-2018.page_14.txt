Advocate , until such Concession Agreement is signed , Courts in Mumbai alone will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide the disputes that may arise between the parties both under the RFQ as well as the RFP . It is only thereafter that if a Concession Agreement is entered into between the Respondent No. 1 and the Special Purpose Vehicle that the arbitration clause will kick in and will govern the disputes that will arise post the Concession Agreement in the performance of the contract between those two parties . He also strongly relied upon a clause in the RFP document which further made this clear , as the Respondent No. 1 could annul the bid process right till the stage of the entering into the Concession Agreement but not thereafter . He also strongly relied upon the letter dated 16.10.2012 , by which the Letter of Award that was granted earlier was “ withdrawn ” showing thereby that there was no agreement that had been entered into between the parties , as otherwise the expression used would have been “ terminated ” . He strongly relied upon this Court ’s judgment in Dresser Rand S.A. vs. Bindal Agro Chem Ltd . And Anr. , ( 2006 ) 1 SCC 751 as followed in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited vs. Telephone 14
