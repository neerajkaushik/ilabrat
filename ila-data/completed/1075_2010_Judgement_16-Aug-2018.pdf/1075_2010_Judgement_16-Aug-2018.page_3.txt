carrying a reverse burden of proof , there had to be strict adherence to the law and procedures . The investigation was not only required to be fair and judicious , but must also appear to have been so . The investigation ought not to be in a manner leaving a genuine apprehension in the mind of the accused that it was not fair and bonafide . No reasons have been furnished why Darshan Singh and ASI Balwinder Singh have not been examined by the prosecution . No explanation has been furnished by PW-1 why he did not deposit the seized narcotics in the malkhana . Likewise , the delay of 9 days in sending the sample for chemical analysis also remains unexplained . The investigation was fundamentally flawed . PW-1 , being the informant , he could not have been the investigating officer himself . Reliance was placed on Bhagwan Singh vs. State of Rajasthan , ( 1976 ) 1 SCC 15 , Megha Singh vs. State of Haryana , 1996 ( 11 ) SCC 709 , State by Inspector of Police , Narcotics Intelligence Bureau , Madurai , Tamilnadu vs. Rajangam , 2010 ( 15 ) SCC 369 .
