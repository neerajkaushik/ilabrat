v. State of Kerala 2000 ( 1 ) KLT 785 to the contrary is overruled . ‚Äù 24 . The view taken by the Kerala High Court in Kader ( supra ) does to meet our approval . It tantamounts to holding that the F.I.R. was a gospel truth , making investigation an empty formality if not a farce . The right of the accused to a fair investigation and fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution will stand negated in that event , with arbitrary and uncanalised powers vested ? with the police in matters relating to the NDPS Act and similar laws carrying a reverse burden of proof . An investigation is a systemic collection of facts for the purpose of describing what occurred and explaining why it occurred . The word systemic suggests that it is more than a whimsical process . An investigator will collect the facts relating to the incident under investigation . The fact is a mere information and is not synonymous with the truth . Kader ( supra ) is , therefore , overruled . We approve the view taken in Naushad ( supra ) . 24
