17 . Hardip Singh vs. State of Punjab , 2008 ( 8 ) SCC 557 concerned a prosecution under the NDPS Act . The contention was that the Inspector , PW-5 being the complainant himself would be an interested person and should not have been made the investigating officer . The argument was repelled relying on State rep. by Inspector of Police , Vigilance and Anti-Corruption , Tiruchirapalli , Tamil Nadu vs. V. Jayapaul , 2004 ( 5 ) SCC 223 observing as follows : “ 6 ... . We find no principle or binding authority to hold that the moment the competent police officer , on the basis of information received , makes out an FIR incorporating his name as the informant , he forfeits his right to investigate . If at all , such investigation could only be assailed on the ground of bias or real likelihood of bias on the part of the investigating officer . The question of bias would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and it is not proper to lay down a broad and unqualified proposition , in the manner in which it has been done by the High Court , that whenever a police officer proceeds to investigate after registering the FIR on his own , the investigation would necessarily be unfair or biased . ” 18
