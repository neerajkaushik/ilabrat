Sub-section ( 3 ) , however , carves out an exception to the prohibition contained in sub-section ( 2 ) . Clause ( a ) thereof saves the right to practice of any medical practitioner of Indian medicine who was not having recognised medical qualification on the date of the commencement of the 1970 Act but who was enrolled on a State Register to practise that system of medicine ; clause ( b ) protects the privileges which include the right to practise any system of medicine which was conferred by or under any law relating to registration of practitioners of Indian medicine for the time being in force in any State on a practitioner of Indian medicine who was enrolled on a State Register of Indian Medicine ; clause ( c ) saves the right of a person to practise Indian medicine in a State in which no State Register of Indian Medicine was maintained at the commencement of that Act provided he has been practising in Indian medicine for not less than five years before the commencement of the Act and clause ( d ) protects the rights conferred by or under the 1956 Act including the right to practise modern medicine possessing any qualification included in that Act . In other words , under clause ( d ) the right to practise modern scientific medicine in all its branches is confined to only such persons who possess any qualification included in the Schedules to the 1956 Act . In view of this conclusion , it matters little if the practitioners registered under the 1970 Act are being involved in various programmes or given postings in hospitals of allopathic medicine and the like . 43 . It will be appropriate to notice that the 1970 Act also maintains a similar distinction between a State Register of Indian Medicine and the Central Register of Indian Medicine . Whereas the State Register of Indian Medicine is maintained under any law for the time being in force in any State regulating the registration of practitioners of Indian medicine , the Central Register of Indian Medicine has to be maintained by the Central Council under Section 23 of that Act . For a person to be registered in the Central Register , Section 25 enjoins that the Registrar should be satisfied that the person concerned was eligible under that Act for such registration . Keeping this position in mind , if we read Section 17 ( 3 ) ( b ) , it becomes clear that the privileges which include the right to practise any system of medicine conferred by or under any law relating to registration of practitioners of Indian medicine for the time being in force in any State ona practitioner of Indian medicine enrolled on a State Register [ 7
