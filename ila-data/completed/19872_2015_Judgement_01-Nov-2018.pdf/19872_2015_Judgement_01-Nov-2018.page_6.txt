6 45 . Bhagwati , J. ( as His Lordship then was ) giving the judgment in Santa Singh [ ( 1976 ) 4 SCC 190 : 1976 SCC ( Cri ) 546 ] pointed out and which was later on accepted in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab [ ( 1980 ) 2 SCC 684 : 1980 SCC ( Cri ) 580 ] that proper exercise of sentencing discretion calls for consideration of various factors like the nature of offence , the circumstances — both extenuating or aggravating , the prior criminal record , if any , of the offender , the age of the offender , his background , his education , his personal life , his social adjustment , the emotional and mental condition of the offender , the prospects for the rehabilitation of the offender , the possibility of his rehabilitation in the life of community , the possibility of treatment or training of the offender , the possibility that the sentence may serve as a deterrent to crime by the offender or by others . After referring to all the aforesaid facts , the learned Judge opined as under : ( Santa Singh case [ ( 1976 ) 4 SCC 190 : 1976 SCC ( Cri ) 546 ] , SCC p. 195 , para 3 ) “ 3 . ... These are factors which have to be taken into account by the court in deciding upon the appropriate sentence , and , therefore , the legislature felt that , for this purpose , a separate stage should be provided after conviction when the court can hear the accused in regard to these factors bearing on sentence and then pass proper sentence on the accused . Hence the new provision in Section 235 ( 2 ) . ” 46 . After analysing the aforesaid aspects , the learned Judge in Santa Singh case [ ( 1976 ) 4 SCC 190 : 1976 SCC ( Cri ) 546 ] posed the question : What is the meaning and content of expression “ hear the accused ” ? By referring to various aspects and also the opinion expressed by the Law Commission in its Forty-eighth Report , Bhagwati , J. ( as His Lordship then was ) opined that the hearing contemplated under Section 235 ( 2 ) is not confined merely to oral submissions but it is also intended to give an opportunity to the prosecution and the accused to place before the court facts and material relating to various factors bearing on the question of sentence . However , there was a note of caution that in the name of such hearing , the court proceedings should not be unduly protracted . 47 . This Court held in Santa Singh [ ( 1976 ) 4 SCC 190 : 1976 SCC ( Cri ) 546 ] that non-compliance with such hearing is not a mere irregularity curable under Section 465 of the 1973 Code . This Court speaking through Bhagwati , J. ( as His Lordship then was ) emphasised that this legal provision under our constitutional values has acquired a new dimension and must reflect “ new trends in penology and sentencing procedures ” so that penal laws can be used as a tool for reforming and rehabilitating the criminals and smoothening out the uneven texture of the social fabric and
