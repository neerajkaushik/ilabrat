14 . In our opinion , the High Court erred in deciding the second appeal much less allowing it without hearing the contesting respondent No. 4 ( appellant herein ) and also erred in dismissing his application filed under Section 151 read with Order 41 Rule 21 of the Code for rehearing of the second appeal . 15 . Having regard to the nature of controversy involved in the case and further in the light of the grounds on which the application for rehearing of the appeal was founded , the High Court should have granted one opportunity of hearing to respondent No. 4 for opposing the second appeal and for that purpose should have restored the second appeal for its re-hearing on merits in accordance with law . 16 . Second and more important , this Court can not countenance the manner in which the High Court decided the second appeal on merits .
