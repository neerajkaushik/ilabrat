12 . Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record of the case , we are inclined to allow the appeal , set aside the impugned order , and acquit the appellant of the charges framed under Section 302 read with Section 148/149 IPC . 13 . In our considered opinion , so far as appellant 's conviction under Section 148/149 IPC is concerned ; the same is not legally sustainable and deserves to be set aside for more than one reasons . 14 . First , it is not in dispute that the appellant was already acquitted by the Sessions Judge for commission of offences falling under Section 148/149IPC . It is also not in dispute that the appellant 's acquittal was not challenged by the State by filing any appeal before the High Court .
