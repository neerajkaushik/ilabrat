25 . There is , therefore , enough case law to suggest that socio-economic factors concerning a convict must be taken into consideration while taking a decision on whether to award a sentence of death or to award a sentence of imprisonment for life . 26 . On the facts of the present case , we find from the decision of the Trial Court that the convict was working as a driver on a casual basis . He was desirous of obtaining employment in the Gulf and was making all attempts in this direction . He managed to arrange a visa but had to pay the agent Rs. 62,000 / - . Due to severe financial constraints he could only arrange Rs. 25,000 / - for making the initial payment . He continued making attempts to raise the amount . His economic condition was so severe that for the purposes of going to Gulf he had to proceed from Ernakulam to Mumbai by train and while he could manage to purchase the ticket , he was unable to pay for reservation charges . Under these circumstances , he had gone to the house of the deceased family for getting money or by stealing it or by grabbing it by any other means . It is under this financial and economic stress that his presence in the house of the deceased family was explained . But unfortunately for him and the deceased family , he was unable to obtain any funds from them and this led to his decision to kill all of them . R.P. ( Crl . ) No. 245 of 2010 in Crl .
