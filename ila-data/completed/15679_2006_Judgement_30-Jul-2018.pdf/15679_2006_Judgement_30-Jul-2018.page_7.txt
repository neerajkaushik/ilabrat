that it dealt with ‘ animal feed ' which was large enough to include ‘ animal feed supplements ' whereas the facts of Surendra Cotton Oil Mills 's case showed that ingredients of animal feed could not be held to be included in ‘ animal feed ' . In our opinion , this Court did not adequately deal with why Sun Exports Corporation 's case which is a binding decision of a three Judges Bench should not be followed , apart from a specious distinction between ‘ ingredients ’ and ‘ supplements ' which is _ logically speaking a distinction without a difference . This being the unsatisfactory state of law as it stands today , we feel that this matter should be placed before Hon ’ ble the Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate Bench to _ resolve the doubts pointed out by us in the body of this Order . ” ( emphasis supplied )
