3 3 . The respondent assailed the said order by filing Original Application No. 206 of 2000 before the Central Administrative Tribunal , Jodhpur Bench at Jodhpur , inter alia , on the ground that the appointment was made by the Board of Officers after they had duly considered the matter and who were competent to issue offer of appointment to the respondent . Further , if there was any irregularity in the appointment process , that could have been enquired into by the department , but without taking recourse to any inquiry , the impugned termination order had been issued . Such action was violative of Article 311 ( 2 ) of the Constitution of India . According to the respondent , his appointment was made after following all the formalities by the department in a fair and transparent manner . He asserted that the department was therefore , estopped from terminating his services . Further , the impugned order is not a termination simpliciter but would cause prejudice to the respondent . It is a stigmatic order indicating that the appointment of the respondent was illegal , for which reason also , principles of natural justice ought to have been adhered to by the department .
