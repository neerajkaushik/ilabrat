11 number of the Municipal plot no. 1443 is also not mentioned in the original deed . There is nothing on record to show that Sardar Balwant Singh is the same as Sardar Baldev Singh . So also , there is nothing on record to show as to why and when the number of the plot , i.e. plot no. 1443 , was inserted in the sale deed which is produced in support of the case of the respondent as Ex.DW1 / 1 . Thus , fabrication of the said deed dated 15.9.1966 ( i.e. Ex.DW1 / 1 ) is evident from comparison of the same with the original sale deed received by the trial Court in the sealed cover from Sub-Registrar ’s office . It is relevant to note that Balwant Singh has nothing to do with the present case . 17 . The sale deed Ex.DW1 / 1 dated 15.9.1966 is in respect of the land measuring 230 square yards out of 567 square yards , obviously had to be carved out of plot nos. 30 , 31 and 34 belonging to Shri Dharampal . The same is clear from the sale deed 5.12.1947 , under which the original owner Udai Chand had sold the three plots in favour of Lala Dharampal , who in turn sold the same in favour of Baldev Singh . Thus , the sale deed Ex.DW1 / 1 can not be in respect of the appellant ’s plot no. 27 .
