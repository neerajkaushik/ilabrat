must be given a more restricted meaning than it might otherwise bear . On the other hand the fact that “ duty of excise ” is itself an expression of very general import is no reason at all for refusing to give to the expression “ tax on sales ” the meaning which it would ordinarily and naturally convey . In these circumstances the question at issue in the present appeal appears to us to lie within a very small compass .
