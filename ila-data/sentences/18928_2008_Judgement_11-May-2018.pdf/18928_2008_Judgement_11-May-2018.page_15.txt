that , for constituting an offence under Section 464 it is imperative that a false document is made and the accused person is the maker of the same , otherwise the accused person is not liable for the offence of forgery . 26 . The definition of “ false document ” is a part of the definition of “ forgery ” . Both must be read together . ‘ Forgery ’ and ‘ Fraud ’ are essentially matters of evidence which could be proved as a fact by direct evidence or by inferences drawn from proved facts . In the case in hand , there is no finding recorded by the trial Court that the respondents have made any false document or part of the document/record to execute mortgage deed under the guise of that ‘ false document ’ . Hence , neither respondent no. 1 nor respondent no. 2 can be held as makers of the forged documents . It is the imposter who can be said to have made the false document by committing forgery . In such an event the trial court as well as appellate court misguided themselves by convicting the accused . Therefore , the High Court has rightly acquitted the accused based on the settled legal position and we find no reason to interfere with the same . 15
