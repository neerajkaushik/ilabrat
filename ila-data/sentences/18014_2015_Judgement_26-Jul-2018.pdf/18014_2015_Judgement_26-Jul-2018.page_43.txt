classification , such trader or manufacturer should not be permitted to enjoy monopoly in respect of all the articles which may come under such broad classification and by that process preclude the other traders or manufacturers from getting registration of separate and distinct goods which may also be grouped under the broad classification . If registration has been given generally in respect of all the articles coming under the broad classification and if it is established that the trader or manufacturer who got such registration had not intended to use any other article except the articles being used by such trader or manufacturer , the registration of such trader is liable to be rectified by limiting the ambit of registration and confining such registration to the specific article or articles which really concern the trader or manufacturer enjoying the registration made in his favour . In our view , if rectification in such circumstances is not allowed , the trader or manufacturer by virtue of earlier registration will be permitted to enjoy the mischief of trafficking in trade mark . Looking to the scheme of the registration of trade mark as envisaged in the Trade Marks Act and the Rules framed thereunder , it appears to us _ that registration of a trade mark can not be held to be absolute , perpetual and _ invariable under all circumstances . Section 12 of the Trade Marks Act prohibits registration of identical or deceptively similar trade marks in respect of goods and description of goods which is _ identical or deceptively similar to the trade mark already registered . For prohibiting registration under Section 12 ( 1 ) , goods in respect of which subsequent registration is sought for , must be ( / ) in respect of goods or description of goods being same or similar and covered ’ by earlier registration and ( jf ) trade mark claimed for such goods must be same or deceptively similar to the trade mark already registered . It may be noted here that under sub-section ( 3 ) of Section 12 of the Trade Marks Act , in an appropriate case of honest concurrent use and/or of other special circumstances , same and deceptively similar trade marks may be permitted to another by the Registrar , subject to such conditions as may deem just and proper to the Registrar . It is also to be noted that the expression “ goods ” and “ description of goods ” appearing in Section 12 ( 1 ) of the Trade Marks Act indicate that registration may be made in respect of Civil Appeal Nos. 2937-2942 of 2018 with Ors .
