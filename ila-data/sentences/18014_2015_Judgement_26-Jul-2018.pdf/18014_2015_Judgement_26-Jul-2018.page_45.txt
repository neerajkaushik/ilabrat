32 . that the proprietor of a trade mark can not enjoy monopoly over the entire class of goods and , particularly , when he is not using the said trade mark in respect of certain goods falling under the same class . In this behalf , we may usefully refer to Section 11 of the Act which prohibits the registration of the mark in respect of the similar goods or different goods but the provisions of this Section do not cover the same class of goods . The aforesaid discussion leads us to hold that all the ingredients laid down in Section 11 ( 2 ) of the Act , as explained by the Delhi High Court in Nestle India Ltd. , have not been satisfied . We are not persuaded to hold , on the facts of this case , that the appellant has adopted the trade mark to take unfair advantage of the trade mark of the respondent . We also hold that use of ‘ NANDHINI ’ by appellant in respect of its different goods would not be detrimental to the purported distinctive character or repute of the trade mark of the respondent . It is to be kept in mind that the appellant had adopted the trade mark in respect of items sold in its restaurants way back in the year 1989 which was soon after the respondent had started using the trade mark ‘ NANDINI ’ . There is no document or material produced by the respondent to Civil Appeal Nos. 2937-2942 of 2018 with Ors . Page 45 of 47
