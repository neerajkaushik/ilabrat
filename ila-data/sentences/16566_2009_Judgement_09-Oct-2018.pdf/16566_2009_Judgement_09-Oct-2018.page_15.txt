purchasers in the proposed building . In such a situation , if for no fault of the developer , the owner seeks to resile from the agreement and terminates the development agreement , it may be difficult to hold that the developer is not entitled to enforce his rights . This of course is dependent on the terms of the agreement in each case . There can not be a uniform formula for determining whether an agreement granting development rights can be specifically enforced and it would depend on the nature of the agreement in each case and the rights created under it . 18 In Chheda Housing Development Corporation v Bibijan Shaikh Farid ' ® , a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court while dealing with the question of whether specific performance should be granted of a development agreement held as follows : “ In our opinion from a conspectus of these judgments , what is relevant would be the facts of each case and the agreement under consideration . Agreements considering what is discussed , amongst others , could be : ( a ) An Agreement only entrusting construction work to a party for consideration . ( b ) An Agreement for entrusting the work of development to a party with added rights to sell the constructed portion to flat purchasers , who would be forming a Co-operative Housing Society to which society , the owner of the land , is obliged to convey the constructed portion as also the land beneath construction on account of statutory requirements . ( c ) A normal agreement for sale of an immovable property . An Agreement of the first type normally is not enforceable as compensation in money is an adequate remedy . An Agreement of the third type would normally be specifically enforceable 15 ( 2007 ) 3 Mah LJ 402 15
