“ Although we find no merit in this appeal , we wanted to give liberty to the plaintiff for amendment of the plaint for the purpose of getting alternative relief by way of return of security of money and damages , if at all suffered , in terms of Section 22 of the Specific Relief Act ; but Mr. Das , the learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant after taking instruction from his client submitted before us that his client did not want to avail of such remedy and wanted to challenge our decision by preferring an appeal if we decided to refuse the prayer for specific performance of the contract . ” The same statement has been made before this Court , as was made before the High Court . In the absence of any plea for damages or monetary relief by the respondents , there is no reason to remit the appeal back to the High Court . 32 . For the above reasons we find no merit in this appeal . The appeal stands dismissed . There shall be no order as to costs .
