between a person and an object forming the subject matter of the ownership . It consists of a complex of rights , all of which are rights in rem , being good against the world and not merely against specific persons . There are various rights or incidents of ownership all of which need not necessarily be present in every case . They may include a right to possess , use and enjoy the thing owned ; and a right to consume , destroy or alienate it . ( Swadesh Ranjan Sinha v Haradeb Banerjee â€™ ) . An essential incident of ownership of land is the right to exploit the development , potential to construct and to deal with the constructed area . In some situations , under a development agreement , an owner may part with such rights to a developer . This in is essence is a parting of some of the incidents of ownership of the immovable property . There could be situations where pursuant to the grant of such rights , the developer has incurred a substantial investment , altered the state of the property and even created third party rights in the property or the construction carried out to be carried out . There could be situations where it is the developer who by his efforts has rendered a property developable by taking steps in law . In development agreements of this nature , where an interest is created in the land or in the development in favour of the developer , it may be difficult to hold that the agreement is not capable of being specifically performed . For example , the developer may have evicted or settled with occupants , got land which was agricultural converted into non-agricultural use , carried out a partial development of the property and pursuant to the rights conferred under the agreement , created third party rights in favour of flat 14 ( 1991 ) 4 SCC 572 14
