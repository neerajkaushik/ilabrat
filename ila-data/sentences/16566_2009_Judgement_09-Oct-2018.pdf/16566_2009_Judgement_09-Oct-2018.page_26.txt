However , the amended section has been notified on 19 September 2018 and the central government has appointed 1 October 2018 as the date on which the provision of Act 18 of 2018 will come into force ? * . However , in the present case , we are not called upon to examine the effect of this amended provision . In any case , we have indicated the reasons why Section 14 ( 3 ) ( c ) was not attracted . 29 . The appellants have relied on the decision of this Court in Her Highness Maharani Shantidevi P Gaikwad v Savjibai Haribai Patel ? ° , where an agreement was entered into between the landowner and the developer for the purpose of construction of houses for the weaker sections on excess vacant land under a scheme sanctioned under Section 21 of the Urban Land ( Ceiling and Regulation ) Act 1976 . This Court reversed the decision of the High Court that granted the decree of specific performance to the developer on the grounds that it was inequitable to enforce specific performance in view of a change in the Master Plan . The court noted that a contract which involved continuous supervision of the court , was not specifically enforceable . Further , in the opinion of the court , at best the plaintiff - builder could claim damages and the expenditure incurred by him for the implementation of the terms of the agreement . The above case has no applicability to the facts of the present case and is of no relevance as the issue in relation to the maintainability of a suit for specific performance by the builder against the owner has not been discussed . 22 § .0.4888 ( E ) dated 19.09.2018 23 AIR 2001 SC 1462 26
