contract he must be having a remedy in the form of approaching a forum for appropriate redressal . A question of maintainability of a suit is completely different from the question of whether the suit will succeed or not on the facts of the case and in the light of the applicable law . Section 14 ( 3 ) ( c ) of the Actcan in no manner be interpreted as debarring a developer from approaching the legal forum for redressal of his grievance . ‚Äù 21 . Inthe present case , the respondent agreed to pay the appellant the costs and expenses along with the agreed remuneration upon completion of the construction . If the respondent failed to pay , the appellant was entitled to realise its money by selling 58 % of the total constructed area . Clauses 6 , 10 and 11 of the agreement indicate that the respondent would retain 42 % of the total constructed area and the balance 58 % would remain secured for due payment of the construction costs . It was further agreed , that the total construction costs shall not exceed 58 % of the constructed area . The intention of the parties is clear from the agreement . This was an agreement to carry out the construction of the building for which payment of the construction costs and agreed remuneration had to be made . The agreement did not create an interest in the land for the developer . If the payment due to the developer was made , there would arise no security interest . Moreover , the security interest in respect of 42 % of the constructed area would arise only if the construction came up and the payment due to the builder was not made . In present case , admittedly there is no construction at all . 18
