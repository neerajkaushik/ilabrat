stage is over with the issue of Letter of Award and no further modification can be acceded to after issue of LOA . ” 28 . Then paragraph 9 says that in view of the delay and defaults by the Respondents the Letter of Award rendered null and void and is hereby withdrawal . It is therefore obvious that after such withdrawal there can not exist any document or even request which can be said to have been incorporated in a contract , factually also the Concession Agreement is not signed by either of the parties and therefore there is no document or reference to a document or contract , the existence of which can fulfill the requirement of Section 7 ( 5 ) of the Act . ” 9 ) An appeal against the said order was filed before the High Court under Section 37of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act , 1996 in which the learned Arbitrator ’s order was set aside . The High Court held that there is a concluded contract between the parties as the Letter of Award had been accepted by the appellant , and that since the arbitration clause forms a part of the bid document between the parties , the arbitration clause would govern the parties . It may be pointed out that an alternative argument was made on behalf of the appellant that even if it was said that the parties were governed by the arbitration clause in question , yet , the clause was “ inapt ” in the language of our judgment in M.R.
