both were sitting in the said car when the alleged incident took place and how it was possible that insofar as one passenger ( namely , Sara Singh ) is concerned , she died and the other one ( namely , respondent No. 2 ) did not suffer even minor injuries . It was , thus , pleaded that when there was nothing to show that chargesheet was false and it has also come on record that accused is a history-sheeter and belongs to influential political family , bail should not have been granted by the High Court . Mr. Bhushan also referred to the following judgments of this Court in support of his contention that it was a fit case for setting aside the order of the High Court granting bail : ( i ) | Neeru Yadav v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr . * â€œ 15 . This being the position of law , it is clear as cloudless sky that the High Court has totally ignored the criminal antecedents of the accused . What has weighed with the High Court is the doctrine of parity . A history-sheeter involved in the nature of crimes which we have reproduced hereinabove , are not minor offences so that he is not to be retained in custody , but the crimes are of heinous nature and such crimes , by no stretch of imagination , can be regarded as jejune . Such cases do create a thunder and lightning having the effect potentiality of torrential rain in an analytical mind . The law expects the judiciary to be alert while admitting these kind of accused persons to be at large and , therefore , the emphasis is on exercise of discretion judiciously and not in a whimsical manner .
