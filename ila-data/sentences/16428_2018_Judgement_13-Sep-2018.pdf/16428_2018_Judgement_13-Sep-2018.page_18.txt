18 to a matter or thing done or not to be done in India , and that , therefore , stamp duty would be payable on such an award . It is important to note that this judgment does not refer to the definition of “ award ” in Item 12 of Schedule | at all .

As has been rightly pointed out by Shri Viswanathan , the said judgment refers to the definition of “ foreign award ” contained in the 1996 Act , but then goes on to rely upon a Supreme Court judgment , stating that such foreign award would not require registration as it can be enforced as a decree . It further went on to rely upon the Supreme Court judgment in M. Anasuya Devi and Anr . v. M. Manik Reddy and Ors. , ( 2003 ) 8 SCC 565 , to state that the Court , while deciding enforceability of a foreign award under Sections 47 and 48 , can not hold the award non-enforceable on the ground of it being unstamped . This also , strictly speaking , is incorrect , as M. Anasuya ( supra ) merely stated , in the context of a domestic award , that the question as to whether an award is required to be stamped would be relevant only at the enforcement stage under Section 36 of the 1996 Act and not at the stage
