4 enforcement of a foreign award , can be enforced in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory in which the award is sought to be enforced . This being so , the New York Convention itself recognizes that foreign awards may have to bear stamp duty for enforcement in the country in which they are sought to be enforced . He further relied upon the 194 Law Commission Report , which had suggested changes insofar as stamp duty is concerned in Part Il of the 1996 Act . 5 . Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent , on the other hand , relied strongly upon the judgment of the Delhi High Court as well as the Madhya Pradesh High Court referred to hereinabove . According to the learned counsel , the expression “ award ” which occurs in Schedule | of the Indian Stamp Act , 1899 applies only to a domestic award and not a foreign award . He relied on the fact that the Indian Stamp Act was enacted in 1899 , in which “ award ” has never been enlarged so as to include foreign awards after the Arbitration ( Protocol and Convention ) Act , 1937 and/or the Foreign Awards ( Recognition and Enforcement ) Act , 1961 were enacted . Also , according to the learned counsel , the only requirement for the enforcement of a foreign award is laid down in Section 47 of the Act , which does not require the award to be stamped . A without prejudice argument was also made that under Section 48 ( 2 ) ( b ) , even if a foreign award were required to be stamped , but is not stamped , enforcement of such award would not be contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law .
