every High Court for initiating suo motu proceedings . 96 . Finally , we request and urge the Chief Justice of each High Court to seriously consider establishing child friendly courts and vulnerable witness courts in each district . Inquiries under the JJ Act and trials under other statutes such as the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act , 2012 , the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act , 2006 , trials for sexual offences under the Indian Penal Code and other similar laws require to be conducted with a high degree of sensitivity , care and empathy for the victim . It is often said that the experience in our courts of a juvenile accused of an offence or the victim of a sexual offence is traumatic . We need to have some compassion towards them â€” even juveniles in conflict with law , since they are entitled to the presumption of innocence - and establishing child friendly courts and vulnerable witness courts is perhaps one manner in which the justice delivery system can respond to ease their pain and suffering . Another advantage of such child friendly courts and vulnerable witness courts is that they can be used for trials in which adult women are victims of sexual offences since they too are often traumatized by the not so friendly setting and environment in our courts . 97 .
