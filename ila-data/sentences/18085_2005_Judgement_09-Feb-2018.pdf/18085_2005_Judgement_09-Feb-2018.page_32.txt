wide-ranging functions . The involvement of civil society through NGOs is a progressive step and these two bodies are expected to take their assistance from time to time . 65 . If these two bodies actually perform their duties , responsibilities and functions in the manner expected of them , the implementation of the JJ Act would no longer be an issue . Unfortunately , we have been informed that these bodies are not functioning in many places or in the manner in which they are expected to and in several districts the District Child Protection Unit has not even been constituted . We expect remedial steps to be taken by all concerned . ( iii ) Juvenile Justice Boards and Child Welfare Committees 66 . With regard to the establishment of JJBs , we were given to understand that most districts now have a JJB , but it is high time that every district in every State must have a JJB . An exception could perhaps be made , such as in some districts of Arunachal Pradesh where there is perhaps no juvenile crime or , there could be some districts where the number of inquiries are very few in which event the JJB may appropriately schedule its sittings . Similarly , a ‘ circuit JJB ’ could be considered if there are some adjacent districts where the number of pending inquires is quite few . W.P. ( C ) No. 473 of 2005 Page 32 of 62
