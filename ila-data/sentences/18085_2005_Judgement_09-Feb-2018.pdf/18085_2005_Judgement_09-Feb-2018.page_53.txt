system is definitely worth implementing and we expect NALSA to go ahead with the suggestion given . In fact , the Chief Justices Conference in 2006 had specifically adverted to the appointment of Visitors to Child Care Institutions and in the Chief Justices Conference in 2013 and 2015 improving the living conditions in Child Care Institutions was also adverted to . NALSA and the District Legal Services Authorities must respect the views expressed in the Chief Justices Conferences . ( vii ) Juvenile Justice Fund 93 . The JJ Act provides for the constitution of a Juvenile Justice Fund . The learned Additional Solicitor General placed before us figures relating to the contribution of the State Governments in the Juvenile Justice Fund . We are quite distressed to note that some of the State Governments have not even set up the Juvenile Justice Fund while one or two State Governments have set up the Fund with an embarrassing amount of only a few thousand rupees . We wonder how the welfare of children can be looked after by these State Governments with such a pittance in the kitty . Obviously , these State Governments are not seriously concerned about the welfare of children , which is a pity . This is yet another example of official apathy to the rights of children and a cause for worry . W.P. ( C ) No. 473 of 2005 Page 53 of 62
