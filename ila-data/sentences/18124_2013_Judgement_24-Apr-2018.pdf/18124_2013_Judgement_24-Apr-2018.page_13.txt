outbreak of emotions or due to sense of insecurity on the part of Respondent No. 2 , the above act was done . Further , the decisions relied upon by learned senior counsel for the parties have no application to the facts of the present case . 15 ) In view of the foregoing discussion , we are of the opinion that the charge under Section 366 of the IPC is not maintainable and the High Court was right in upholding so . We are in agreement with the order passed by the High Court . However , since the matter is pending since 2003 and is still at the stage of charge framing , we deem it appropriate to direct the trial Court to conclude the trial within 6 ( months ) from the date of passing of this judgment . It is also made clear that the observations recorded in this judgment are for the purpose of applicability of Section 366 of the IPC only and trial Court shall decide the matter on merits . The appeal is dismissed . vescseusestesssesttesseseeseesesteseeseaees Ji ( A.K. SIKRI ) seceseseetcatestsesecstestesesesteseesesens J. ( R.K. AGRAWAL ) NEW DELHI ; APRIL 24 , 2018 . 13
