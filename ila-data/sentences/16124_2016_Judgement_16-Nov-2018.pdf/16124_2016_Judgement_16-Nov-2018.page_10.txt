18 . The Claims Tribunal is empowered to treat the report of the accident on its receipt as if it is an application made by the claimant for award of the compensation to him under the Act by virtue of Section 166 ( 4 ) of the Act and thus has jurisdiction to decide such application on merits in accordance with law . 19 . The object of Section 158 ( 6 ) read with Section 166 ( 4 ) of the Act is essentially to reduce the period of pendency of claim case and quicken the process of determination of compensation amount by making it mandatory for registration of motor accident claim within one month from the date of receipt of FIR of the accident without the claimants having to file a claim petition .
