6 a full-fledged trial , such an enquiry would be outside the purview of Section 15 . The Collector does not exercise the powers of a Court upon receipt of a notice and when he transmits the notice for consideration at a meeting of the elected members of the Kshettra Panchayat . Hence , it would not be open to the Collector to resolve or enter findings of fact on seriously disputed questions such as forgery , fraud and coercion . However , consistent with the law which has been laid down by the Full Bench in Mathura Prasad Tewari 's case , it is open to the Collector , having due regard to the nature and ambit of his jurisdiction under sub-section ( 3 ) to determine as to whether the requirements of a valid notice under sub-section ( 2 ) of Section 15 have been fulfilled . The proceeding before the Collector under sub-section ( 2 ) of Section 15 of the Act of 1961 is more in the nature of a summary proceeding . The Collector for the purpose of Section 15 , does not have the trappings of a Court exercising jurisdiction on the basis of evidence adduced at a trial of a judicial proceeding . Whether in a given case , the Collector has transgressed the limits of his own jurisdiction is a matter which can be addressed in a challenge under Article 226 of the Constitution . We clarify that we have not provided an exhaustive enumeration or list of circumstances in which the Collector can determine the validity of the notice furnished under sub-section ( 2 ) in each case and it is for the Collector in the first instance and for the Court in the exercise of its power of judicial review , if it is moved , to determine as to whether the limits on the power of the Collector have been duly observed . ‚Äù ( emphasis supplied )
