CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 597 OF 2018 to make her/his choice . The courts can not , as long as the choice remains , assume the role of parens patriae . The daughter is entitled to enjoy her freedom as the law permits and the court should not assume the role of a super guardian being moved by any kind of sentiment of the mother or the egotism of the father . We say so without any reservation . ‚Äù It may be significant to note that insofar as Thushara is concerned , she has expressed her desire to be with appellant No. 1 . Accordingly , we allow this appeal and set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court . However , since Thushara has not appeared as she was not made party in these proceedings , while setting aside the directions of the High Court entrusting the custody of Thushara to respondent No . 4 , we make it clear that the freedom of choice would be of Thushara as to with whom she wants to live .
