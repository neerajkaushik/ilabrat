10 . Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record of the case , we are not inclined to interfere in the impugned order and dispose of the appeal as indicated below for ensuring its compliance by the appellant . 11 . We have perused the order of the learned Single Judge and the impugned order , which resulted in quashing Mr. Kalappa 's termination order resulting in directing his reinstatement in service . 12 . Having gone through the orders , in the facts of this case , we do not find any good ground to uphold the termination order and set aside the impugned order . 13 . In our view , the two courts below rightly set aside the termination order , which does not call for any interference in this appeal .
