9 also the fact that in the appointment order it is stated that the appointment is on “ regular basis ” . 15 . In the light of the above discussion , we do not find any good ground warranting interference with the impugned order . In the light of the above discussion , there is no further necessity to examine the certificate of the respondent as observed by the Division Bench . 16 . Admittedly the respondent has not worked with the appellants from 2012 till date . In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case , we modify the order of the High Court with regard to the back wages to the extent that the same be reduced to 40 % with effect from 2012 till the date of joining and the appeal is partly allowed to that extent . 17 . The above judgment is passed in the special facts and circumstances of the present case and may not be treated as a precedent in future . [ R.
