Committee recommended that 5 questions be deleted and in 2 questions , key answers be changed . It can be presumed that these committees consisted of experts in various subjects for which the examinees were tested . Judges can not take on the role of experts in academic matters . Unless , the candidate demonstrates that the key answers are patently wrong on the face of it , the courts can not enter into the academic field , weigh the pros and cons of the arguments given by both sides and then come to the conclusion as to which of the answer is better or more correct . 14 . In the present case we find that all the 3 questions needed a long process of reasoning and the High Court itself has noticed that the stand of the Commission is also supported by certain text books . When there are conflicting views , then the court must bow down to the opinion of the experts . Judges are not and can not be experts in all fields and , therefore , they must exercise great restraint and should not overstep their jurisdiction to upset the opinion of the experts .
