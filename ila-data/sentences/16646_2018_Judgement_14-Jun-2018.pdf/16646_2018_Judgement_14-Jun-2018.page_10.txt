As far as the objection of the appellant - Rahul Singh is concerned , after going through the question on which he raised an objection , we ourselves are of the prima facie view that the answer given by the Commission is correct . 16 . In view of the above discussion we allow the appeal filed by the U.P. Public Service Commission and set aside the judgment of the Allahabad High Court . The appeals filed by Rahul Singh and Jay Bux Singh and Others are dismissed . All pending applications stand disposed of . ssempseniaemeistoraysseneeernennrstsnerinesoncreimese J.
