In Ran Vijay Singh and Others vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Others ’ , this Court after referring to a catena of judicial pronouncements summarized the legal position in the following terms : “ 30 . The law on the subject is therefore , quite clear and we only propose to highlight a few significant conclusions . They are : 30.1 . If a statute , Rule or Regulation governing an examination permits the re-evaluation of an answer sheet or scrutiny of an answer sheet as a matter of right , then the authority conducting the examination may permit it ; 30.2 . If a statute , Rule or Regulation governing an examination does not permit re-evaluation or scrutiny of an answer sheet ( as distinct from prohibiting it ) then the court may permit re-evaluation or scrutiny only if it is demonstrated very clearly , without any “ inferential process of reasoning or by a process of rationalisation ” and only in rare or exceptional cases that a material error has been committed ; 30.3 . The court should not at all re-evaluate or scrutinise the answer sheets of a candidate — it has no expertise in the matter and academic matters are best left to academics ; 2 ( 2018 ) 2 SCC 357
