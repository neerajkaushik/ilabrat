D families , the complainant has filed his affidavit seeking permission to compound the offence ‚Äù 5 . We have also gone through the evidence available on record . Having heard the learned counsel appearing on both sides and also the _ defacto complainant , we are of the view that the conviction need be sustained only in the case of Accused No. 1 . Accordingly , the appeals are allowed as follows : i ) The conviction of Accused No. 1 under Sections 354 and 448 IPC read with Section 3 ( 1 ) ( xi ) is sustained . The mandatory minimum period of sentence is six months . We are informed that the first accused has undergone a sentence of around one year . Therefore , the sentence is limited to the _ period already undergone . ii ) As far as Accused Nos. 2 , 3 and 4 are concerned , we set aside their conviction and acquit them of the charges .
