9 ) Learned counsel for the appellant-State has made only one submission . According to him , the High Court while dismissing the application for leave to appeal did not assign any reason and hence the impugned order is rendered bad in law . It was his submission that there were _ several discrepancies and errors in the judgment of the Sessions Judge against which the leave to appeal was sought and , therefore , this was a fit case where the High Court should have granted leave to appeal for further probing into the case by the Appellate Court . In support of his submission , he placed reliance on the decision of this Court in State of Maharashtra vs. Sujay Mangesh Poyarekar , ( 2008 ) 9 SCC 475 . 10 ) We are inclined to agree in part with the submission urged by the learned counsel for the appellant .
