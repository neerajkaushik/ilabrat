14 consideration not commensurate with its worth without attracting Article 14 and Article 39 ( b ) of the Constitution . ‚Äù ( emphasis supplied ) From the above decisions , the following principles may be culled out : ( i ) Generally , when any land is intended to be transferred by the state , or any state largesse is to be conferred , resort should be had to public auction or transfer by way of inviting tenders from the people . The state must ensure that it receives adequate compensation for the allotted resource . However , non-floating of tender or nonconducting of public auction would not be deemed in all cases to be an arbitrary exercise of executive power . The ultimate decision of the executive must be the result of a fair decisionmaking process . ( ii ) The allocation must be guided by _ the consideration of the common good as per Article 39 ( b ) , and must not be violative of Article 14 . This does not necessarily entail auction of the resource ; however , allocation of natural resources to private persons for commercial exploitation solely for private benefit , with no social or welfare purpose , attracts higher judicial scrutiny and may be held to be violative of Article 14 if done by non-competitive and non-revenue maximizing means .
