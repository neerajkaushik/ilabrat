Consequently , this Court was compelled to take the assistance of a senior officer from the office of the CAG to determine the amount collected as cess for the benefit of construction workers and ascertain where the amount was actually being spent . 48 . The affidavits filed by the office of the CAG indicated that the amount collected as cess for the benefit of construction workers was in the region of about Rs. 27,000 crores and about Rs. 29,000 crores . The affidavits also indicated that some State Governments had not even bothered to transfer the amount to the State Welfare Board . Overall , the affidavits gave a clear picture of a shocking state of affairs inasmuch as some Welfare Boards had expenditure out of the collected cess for payment of entry tax/value added tax , purchase of washing machines for construction workers and purchase of laptops for construction workers . This Court found that rather astonishing since it appeared that there was no rationale in providing washing machines and laptops to construction workers who were by and large poor and uneducated as well as migrant labour . Be that as it may , it also came to notice that huge amounts were being spent for administrative purposes W.P. ( C ) No. 318 of 2006 etc . Page 32 of 57
