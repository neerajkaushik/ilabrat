( in covered areas ) ; any establishment , employing 10 or more building construction workers may fall within the purview of the Employees ’ State Insurance Act , 1948 ( in covered areas ) , and within the purview of the Employees ’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act , 1952 and also within the purview of the BOCW Act . 52 . In other words , a large number of benefits are available to building and construction workers but an effort is needed to ensure that all the concerned authorities sit together for the benefit of these building and construction workers , on whose account thousands of crores of rupees are being collected under the Cess Act . 53 . It is disclosed by the Union of India in its affidavit dated 9 " October , 2015 that not a single State Advisory Committee , anywhere in the country held a single meeting during the previous 12 months . This is a clear indication that there is a total lack of concern and apathy on the part of the powers that be in doing anything substantial for the benefit of construction workers . This is indeed an extremely sorry state of affairs that puts a Shakespearean tragedy to shame . The members of the State Advisory Committee must appreciate that they have a huge responsibility , which they must discharge or give up their position , and make way for somebody else to take over the responsibility .
