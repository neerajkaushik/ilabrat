effective compliance with the provisions of the BOCW Act and that the Monitoring Committee is supervising these efforts so that all necessary entitlements and benefits are passed on to the construction workers . 67 . It will be seen from the figures on record that the quantum of cess collected in one quarter from 31 Â° March , 2017 till 30 " June , 2017 is in the region of about Rs. 5000 crores . ( The difference between the figure given by the Secretary in the Ministry of Labour and Employment and the Standing Committee ) . This is a huge amount and would work out to about Rs. 20,000 crores annual collection . The figures presented to us by the CAG or even the Standing Committee do not reflect such a huge collection . Obviously , there is something terribly rotten with the collection and accounting mechanism and it is quite clear that the exercise of registration , both of the establishments and of the construction workers is not being carried out satisfactorily . This is an area that has to be very seriously looked into by all the State Governments and the UTAs as well as by the Ministry of Labour and Employment . Unless there is effective and full compliance of the provisions regarding collection of cess , several establishments will remain outside the net and thousands of beneficiaries will be denied what is constitutionally and statutorily due to them . 68 . Our first direction , therefore , is to the Ministry of Labour and W.P. ( C ) No. 318 of 2006 etc . Page 46 of 57
