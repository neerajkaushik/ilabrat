19 . The Court then came to the conclusion that there is a clear distinction between a tax and a fee and looking to the purpose of the BOCW Act and the Cess Act , it was held that the levy of cess was a fee and not a tax . 20 . The interpretation of the BOCW Act and the Cess Act was again considered in A. Prabhakara Reddy and Company v. State of Madhya Pradesh . ’ The emphasis in this case was on registering the construction workers and providing them necessary benefits . Since the levy of cess is a fee , it was urged that urgent steps should be taken for implementation of the two Acts . It was further observed that merely because there was some delay in the effective implementation of both the statutes it could not be a ground for invalidating the levy of cess , nor could the levy of cess be said to have retrospective application . It was held as follows : “ The fact that the task of registering the workers and providing them the benefit may take some time , would not affect the liability to pay the levy as per the Cess Act . Any other interpretation would defeat the rights of the workers whose protection is the principal aim or primary concern and objective of the BOCW Act as well as the Cess Act . Cess is a fee for service and hence , its calculation , as per settled law is not to be strictly in accordance with quid pro quo rule and does not require any mathematical exactitude . The scheme of the BOCW Act , the Cess Act and the Rules warrant that the lawfully imposable cess should be imposed , collected and put in the statutory welfare fund without delay so that the benefits may flow to the eligible workers at the earliest . The scheme of the BOCW Act or the Cess Act does not warrant that unless all the workers are already registered or the welfare fund is duly credited or the welfare measures are made available , no cess can be levied .
