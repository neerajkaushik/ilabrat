43 . Unfortunately , the affidavits filed did not take the matter of utilization of funds any further , in the sense that the State Governments and UTAs had no clue on how to spend the cess that had been collected ; on the contrary , it appeared that the cess collected was being used for purposes other than for the benefit of construction workers , such as for advertisements etc . Faced with this situation , we had no option but to request the Secretary in the Ministry of Labour and Employment of the Government of India to be present in Court along with a possible action plan concerning the utilization of the collected cess . 44 . When the Secretary in the Ministry of Labour and Employment appeared in Court on wu " September , 2015 he informed us of certain positive steps contemplated by the Government of India . We noted three such steps : ( i ) Introducing a Universal Access Number to be provided to every construction worker so that if he or she migrates from one State to another , the benefit of registration does not get lost , nor does that construction worker need to get registered in the other State ; ( ii ) Registration of construction workers - we were informed that though there were more than 4 crores construction workers , only about 1.5 crores had been registered with the concerned authorities . It was expected that the remaining construction workers would be registered before the end of the financial year W.P. ( C ) No. 318 of 2006 etc . Page 29 of 57
