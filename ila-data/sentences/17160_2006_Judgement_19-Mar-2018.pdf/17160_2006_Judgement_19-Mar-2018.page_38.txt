( d ) Sobering features : Two sobering features come out of the affidavits filed by the Union of India . They are : ( i ) There is a move to provide a Universal Access Number with portability to construction workers . However , this would require some legislative changes and a huge campaign and effort by the Union of India , the State Governments and Union Territory Administrations . It is not clear whether any one of them has the will or desire to ensure that through the provision of a Universal Access Number , the construction workers will be given the benefits that they are legitimately entitled to ; ( ii ) The second sobering feature is disclosed in the affidavit of 26 " February , 2016 where the Union of India has provided a tabular statement showing that several States have complied with some directions issued by the Union of India under Section 60 of the BOCW Act . Although this is heartening , full compliance of the provisions of the various statutes enacted for the benefit of construction workers is still far away . ( e ) A positive development that has taken place is the announcement by NALSA of the Legal Services to the Workers in the Unorganised Sector Scheme , 2015 . The efficacy of this Scheme and its implementation has not yet been evaluated , but given the track record of NALSA , we are fairly confident that it is taking necessary steps in the right direction . ( f ) Monitoring Committee : On 10 " November , 2017 it was stated before us by W.P. ( C ) No. 318 of 2006 etc . Page 38 of 57
