BOCW Act as well as the Cess Act . 4 . Every State Government and UTA should establish a Welfare Board in terms of Section 18 of the BOCW Act . It must be appreciated that this is not a body that can be created by an executive order . The law requires that the Welfare Board shall be a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal . There are therefore legal formalities to be carried out for the constitution of a Welfare Board . 5 . Every State Government and UTA should establish a Welfare Fund for the benefit of the construction workers , with appropriate tules for utilisation of the funds . 6 . It is imperative that all construction workers should be given identity cards and should be registered in terms of Section 12 of the BOCW Act . The Ministry of Labour and Employment has proposed the issuance of a Universal Access Number for each construction worker . We make no comment or observation about the efficacy or otherwise of a Universal Access Number . It was submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that smart cards should be issued to all construction workers . We keep this issue open and leave it to the Ministry of Labour and Employment to W.P. ( C ) No. 318 of 2006 etc . Page 53 of 57
