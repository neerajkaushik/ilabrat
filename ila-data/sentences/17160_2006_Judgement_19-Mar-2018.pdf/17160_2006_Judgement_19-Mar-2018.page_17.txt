Consequently , in the absence of any statutory rules having been framed by any State Government , it would be well-nigh impossible for a construction worker to obtain the benefits due to him or her under the provisions of the BOCW Act . 25 . For the purposes of framing statutory Rules , Section 5 of the BOCW Act postulates the State Government constituting one or more Expert Committee consisting of persons specially qualified in building or other construction work for advising the State Government in drafting the rules . 26 . Based on the submissions made , the Court called for factual information from the State Governments to be provided within eight weeks . 27 .
