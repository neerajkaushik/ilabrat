construction workers . This is not only a tragedy , but a travesty of justice , but we will advert to this a little later . 32 . Realizing the significance and the importance of the provisions regarding the appointment of registering officers , registration of establishments and construction workers and setting up of the Welfare Boards ( none of which had apparently been complied with ) the Court gave the following direction on 13 " January , 2009 : “ We direct the Chief Secretary of the respective States and Secretary ( Labour ) of each States and the Union Territories to take timely steps as per the provisions of the [ BOCW ] Act , if not already done . We would like to have the appraisal report in the first week of May as to what steps have been taken in this regard . If any of the State Government has not done anything pursuant to the Act , urgent steps are to be taken so that the benefits of this legislation shall not go waste . Otherwise the unorganized workers of the construction sector will be denied the benefit of the Act . ” 33 . Thereafter , on 18 " January , 2010 the Court passed a set of directions so that the provisions of the BOCW Act could be effectively implemented . * The directions passed by this Court are as follows : " 1 . Welfare Boards have to be constituted by each State with adequate full time staff within three months . 2 .
