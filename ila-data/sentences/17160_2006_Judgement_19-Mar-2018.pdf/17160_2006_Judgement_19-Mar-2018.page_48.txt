large number of schemes allegedly for the benefit of construction workers . The multiplicity of schemes brings to mind the adage that too many cooks spoil the broth . Keeping a track of these schemes is by itself an enormous task , perhaps resulting in administrative issues and red tape . It would be worthwhile if a model scheme is framed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment , which appears to be best equipped to do so , taking the best practices ( so to speak ) of the existing schemes . This model scheme can then be made available to all concerned , that is , the State Governments , the UTAs and the Welfare Boards with the flexibility of making appropriate modifications wherever necessary . 71 . Our third direction , therefore , is to the Ministry of Labour and Employment to frame one composite Model Scheme for the benefit of construction workers in consultation with all stakeholders including NGOs who are actually working at the grassroots level with construction workers . While there is an urgency in framing such a Model Scheme , we would caution the Ministry of Labour and Employment to make haste slowly and to prepare a Model Scheme that is comprehensive and can easily be implemented , is pragmatic and does not involve too much paperwork . 72 . In preparing the Model Scheme , we expect the Ministry of Labour and Employment to include within it , inter alia , issues and concerns of W.P. ( C ) No. 318 of 2006 etc . Page 48 of 57
