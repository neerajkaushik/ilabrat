amounts involved . 75 . On the issue of audits , it would be worthwhile and relevant for the State Governments and the Welfare Boards in every State and UTA to conduct a social audit . The CAG has prepared detailed guidelines for conducting a social audit in respect of some other schemes ( for example , the Report of the Working Group on Developing Social Audit Standards with reference to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act , 2005 ) and these guidelines can be adapted mutatis mutandis for carrying out a social audit in respect of the implementation of the BOCW Act . 76 . Our fourth direction is to the Ministry of Labour and Employment , the State Governments and the UTAs to conduct a social audit on the implementation of the BOCW Act so that in future there is better and more effective and meaningful implementation of the BOCW Act . If a mistake has occurred , and we have no doubt that hundreds of mistakes have occurred in the implementation of the BOCW Act , it is more appropriate to admit the mistake for a better future rather than to justify it or continue to repeat the mistake . This is more so in the case of the BOCW Act where crores of men , women and children are involved on a day-to-day basis and Parliament has thought it appropriate to legislate for their benefit .
