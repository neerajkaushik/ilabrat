has wide discretion in awarding the sentence within the statutory limits . Since in many offences only the maximum punishment is prescribed and for some offences the minimum punishment is prescribed , each Judge exercises his discretion accordingly . There can not , therefore , be any uniformity . However , this Court has repeatedly held that the Courts will have to take into account certain principles while exercising their discretion in sentencing , such as proportionality , deterrence and _ rehabilitation . In a proportionality analysis , it is necessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the commensurate punishment for the offender . The seriousness of an offence depends , apart from other things , also upon its harmfulness . 11 . This Court in the case of Soman Vs. State of Kerala [ ( 2013 ) 11 SCC 382 ] observed thus : “ 27.1 . Courts ought to base sentencing decisions on various different rationales — most prominent amongst which would _ be proportionality and deterrence . 27.2 . The question of consequences of criminal action can be relevant from both a proportionality and deterrence standpoint . 27.3 . Insofar as proportionality is concerned , the sentence must be commensurate with the seriousness or gravity of the offence .
