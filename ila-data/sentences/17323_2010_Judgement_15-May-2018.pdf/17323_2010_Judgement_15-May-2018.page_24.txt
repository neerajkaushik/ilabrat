24 28 . It is important to have a look at the evidence of PW 5-Dr . Arvind Kanwar who has conducted Post mortem and according to him there was an incised wound on the right parietal region of size 4 ” and 10 ” above right ear and another incised wound of 1 ” in size on the right index finger . He has deposed that “ the brain was found congested , yet no fracture was seen on the scalp ” . Though in the cross examination he has stated at one place that the injury No 2 on the scalp might be ‘ grievous ’ that caused brain hemorrhage . This particular fact is not noted in the postmortem report . Regarding the cause of such injury , PWS stated that it can be caused by striking with sharp edged object and the depth of the scalp injury depends upon the force and speed . He maintains the stand that it was a ‘ scalp injury ’ and not ‘ skull injury ’ . Moreover , he did not measure the depth of the head injury which was necessary for classification of injury .
