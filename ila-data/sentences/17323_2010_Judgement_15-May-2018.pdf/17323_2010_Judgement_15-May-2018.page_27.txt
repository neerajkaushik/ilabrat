When several persons of the accused group wielding weapons attacked the deceased , it is surprising to see only two injuries , that too , two simple injuries alone are inflicted ; of course , one such simple injury turns out to be fatal sometime later . This circumstance demonstrates that the appellant had no intention to cause death , though he has knowledge that the weapon used by him to inflict injury on the scalp of the deceased may cause death . But in the absence of intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death , the offence does not fall within the scope of Section 300 , IPC but it will fall within Section 304 , Part II of the IPC . 32 . We , therefore , hold that the appellants Manoj Kumar , Rangeel Singh and Surinder Singh are guilty for an offence punishable under Section 304 Part II IPC and not for the offence under Sec . 300 IPC . Their conviction under Section 302 IPC
