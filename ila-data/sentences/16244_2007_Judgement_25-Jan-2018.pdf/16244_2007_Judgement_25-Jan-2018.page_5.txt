9 . Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record of the case , we find no merit in the appeal . In our opinion , the High Court was right and hence the impugned judgment does not call for any interference . 10 . In the first place , the High Court convicted four accused persons under Section 325 read with section 34 IPC and not under Section 307 IPC . In other words , in the opinion of the High Court , no case was made out under Section 307 IPC , but it was essentially a case of a " grievous hurt " falling under Section 325 IPC . 11 . This finding of the High Court , in our opinion , is based on proper appreciation of entire prosecution evidence and we do not find any reason to disturb it for convicting the respondents under Section 325 IPC instead of Section 307 IPC .
