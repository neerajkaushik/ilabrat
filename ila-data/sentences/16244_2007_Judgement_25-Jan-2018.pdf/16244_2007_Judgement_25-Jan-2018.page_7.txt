quantum of fine awarded in 1988 or so appears to be just and reasonable . Moreover , it is the sole discretion of the Trial Court and , in this case , the High Court to decide the quantum of fine amount . 15 . Taking into account all these facts , which have emerged from the facts of the case , we find no reason to take a different view from that of the High Court , which does not call for any interference in this appeal . 16 . The appeal thus fails and is accordingly dismissed . ( R.K. Agrawal ) cniNG HERES HEED J. ( Abhay Manohar Sapre ) New Delhi , January 25 , 2018
