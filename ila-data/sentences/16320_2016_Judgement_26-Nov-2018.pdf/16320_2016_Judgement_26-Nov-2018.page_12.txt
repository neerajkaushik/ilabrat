â€œ 38 . We have noticed various decisions and tried to explain and reconcile them as far as possible . In view of the aforesaid discussion , we summarise our conclusion thus : 38.1 . Information given to the employer by a candidate as to conviction , acquittal or arrest , or pendency of a criminal case , whether before or after entering into service must be true and there should be no suppression or false mention of required information . 38.2 . While passing order of termination of services or cancellation of candidature for giving false information , the employer may take notice of special circumstances of the case , if any , while giving such information . 38.3 . The employer shall take into consideration the government orders/instructions/rules , applicable to the employee , at the time of taking the decision . 38.4 . In case there is suppression or false information of involvement in a criminal case where conviction or acquittal had already been recorded before filling of the application/verification form and such fact later comes to knowledge of employer , any of the following recourses appropriate to the case may be adopted : 38.4.1 . In a case trivial in nature in which conviction had been recorded , such as shouting slogans at young age or for a petty offence which if disclosed would not have rendered an incumbent unfit for post in question , the employer may , in its discretion , ignore such suppression of fact or false information by condoning the lapse . 38.4.2 . Where conviction has been recorded in case which is not trivial in nature , employer may cancel candidature or terminate services of the employee . 12
