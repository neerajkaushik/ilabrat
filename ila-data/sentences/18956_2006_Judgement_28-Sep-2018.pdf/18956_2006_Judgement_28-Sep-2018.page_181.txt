PART A has segregated matters of religious practice from secular activities , including those of an economic , financial or political nature . The expression “ other secular activity ” which follows upon the expression “ economic , financial , political ” indicates that matters of a secular nature may be regulated or restricted by law . The fact that these secular activities are associated with or , in other words , carried out in conjunction with religious practice , would not put them beyond the pale of legislative regulation . The second category consists of laws providing for ( i ) social welfare and reform ; or ( ii ) throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus . The expression “ social welfare and reform ” is not confined to matters only of the Hindu religion . However , in matters of temple entry , the Constitution recognised the disabilities which Hindu religion had imposed over the centuries which restricted the rights of access to dalits and to various groups within Hindu society . The effect of clause ( 2 ) of Article 25 is to protect the ability of the state to enact laws , and to save existing laws on matters governed by sub-clauses ( a ) and ( b ) . Clause ( 2 ) of Article 25 is clarificatory of the regulatory power of the state over matters of public order , morality and health which already stand recognised in clause ( 1 ) . Clause 1 makes the right conferred subject to public order , morality and health . Clause 2 does not circumscribe the ambit of the ‘ subject to public order , morality or health ’ stipulation in clause 1 . What clause 2 indicates is that the authority of the state to enact laws on the categories is not trammelled by Article 25 . 10
