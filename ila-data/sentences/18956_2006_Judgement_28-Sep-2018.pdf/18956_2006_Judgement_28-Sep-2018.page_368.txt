Amendment No. 301 was also proposed by Mr. Tajamul Hussain for inclusion of : “ places of worship ” , “ Dharamshalas , and Musafirkhanas ” at the end of sub-clause ( a ) .2 ¢ All these proposals were voted upon , and rejected by the Constituent Assembly .2 ” ? The Assembly considered it fit not to include ‘ places of worship ’ or ‘ temples ’ within the ambit of Draft Article 9 of the Constitution . The conscious deletion of “ temples ” and “ places of worship ” from the Draft Article 9 ( 1 ) has to be given due consideration . The contention of the learned Amicus Curiae that the Sabarimala Temple would be included within the ambit of ‘ places of public resort ’ under Article 15 ( 2 ) can not be accepted . 10 . ROLE OF COURTS IN MATTERS CONCERNING RELIGION 10.1 . The role of Courts in matters concerning religion and religious practises under our secular Constitutional set up is to afford protection under Article 25 ( 1 ) to those practises which are regarded as “ essential ” or “ integral ” by the devotees , or the religious community itself . In Bijoe Emmanuel & Ors . v. State of Kerala & Ors . ( supra ) , this Court noted that the personal views of judges are irrelevant in ascertaining whether a particular religious belief or practise must receive the protection guaranteed under Article 25 ( 1 ) .
