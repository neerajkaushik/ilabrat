The assumption in such a claim is that a deviation from the celibacy and austerity observed by the followers would be caused by the presence of women . Such a claim can not be sustained as a constitutionally sustainable argument . Its effect is to impose the burden of a man ’s celibacy on a woman and construct her as a cause for deviation from celibacy . This is then employed to deny access to spaces to which women are equally entitled . To suggest that women can not keep the Vratham is to stigmatize them and stereotype them as being weak and lesser human beings . A constitutional court such as this one , must refuse to recognize such claims . 56 Human dignity postulates an equality between persons . The equality of all human beings entails being free from the restrictive and dehumanizing effect of stereotypes and being equally entitled to the protection of law . Our Constitution has willed that dignity , liberty and equality serve as a guiding light for individuals , the state and this Court . Though our Constitution protects religious freedom and consequent rights and practices essential to religion , this Court will be guided by the pursuit to uphold the values of the Constitution , based in dignity , liberty and equality . In a constitutional order of priorities , these are values on which the edifice of the Constitution stands . They infuse our constitutional order with a vision for the future — of a just , equal and dignified society . Intrinsic to these values is the anti-exclusion principle . Exclusion is destructive of dignity . To exclude a woman from the might of worship is fundamentally at odds with constitutional values . 76
