7 . In Durgah Committee , Ajmer and Anr . v. Syed Hussain Ali and Ors. , ( 1962 ) 1 SCR 383 , ( “ Durgah Committee ” ) , this Court was faced with a challenge to the vires of the Durgah Khwaja Saheb Act , 1955 . The famous tomb of Khwaja Moin-ud-din Chishti of Ajmer was managed by a group of persons who belonged to the Chishti Order of Soofies . The argument that as people from all religious faiths came to worship at this shrine , and that , therefore , it could not be said to be a shrine belonging to any particular religious denomination , was negated as follows : a GA Thus on theoretical considerations it may not be easy to hold that the followers and devotees of the saint who visit the Durgah and treat it as a place of pilgrimage can be regarded _ as _ constituting a religious denomination or any section thereof . However , for the purpose of the present appeal we propose to deal with the dispute between the parties on the basis that the Chishtia sect whom the respondents purport to represent and on whose behalf — ( as well as their own ) — they seek to challenge the vires of the Act is a section or a religious denomination . This position appears to have been assumed in the High Court and we do not propose to make any departure in that behalf in dealing with the present appeal . ” ( emphasis supplied ) ( at p. 401 ) 23
