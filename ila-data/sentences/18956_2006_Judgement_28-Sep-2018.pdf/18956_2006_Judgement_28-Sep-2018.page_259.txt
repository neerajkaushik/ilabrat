PART H 67 ~ The stand of the Board demonstrates that the practice of excluding women of a particular age group has not been consistently followed . The basis of the claim that there exists a religious denomination of Ayyapans is that the presiding deity is celibate and a strict regime of forty one days is prescribed for worship . Women between the age groups of ten and fifty would not for physiological reasons ( it is asserted ) be able to perform the penance associated with worship and hence their exclusion is intrinsic to a common faith . As indicated earlier , the exclusion of women between the ages of ten and fifty has not been shown to be a uniform practice or tenet . The material before the Kerala High Court in Mahendran in fact indicates that there was no such uniform tenet , down the ages . Therefore , the claim that the exclusion of women is part of a common set of religious beliefs held by those who worship the deity is not established . Above all , what is crucial to a religious denomination is a religious sect or body . Acommon faith and spiritual organisation must be the chord which unites the adherents together . 68 Justice Rajagopala Ayyangar in his concurring judgement in Saifuddin , emphasised the necessity of an identity of doctrines , creeds and tenets in a ‘ religious denomination ’ : “ 52 ... The identity of a religious denomination consists in the identity of its doctrines , creeds and tenets and these are intended to ensure the unity of the faith which its adherents profess and the identity of the religious views are the bonds of the union which binds them together as one community . ” 88
