worship for Hindus . A representative suit was filed under Order | Rule 8 of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 on behalf of all Deoprayagi Pandas who , as guides or escorts of pilgrims , sought a declaration that they can not be obstructed from entering the precincts of the temple along with their “ clients ” for darshan of the deities inside the temple . This Court held : “ It seems to us that the approach of the court below to this aspect of the case has not been quite proper , and , to avoid any possible misconception , we would desire to state succinctly what the correct legal position is . Once it is admitted , as in fact has been admitted in the present case , that the temple is a public place of worship of the Hindus , the right of entrance into the temple for purposes of ‘ darshan ’ or worship is a right which flows from the nature of the institution itself , and for the acquisition of such rights , no custom or immemorial usage need be asserted or proved . As the Panda as well as his client are both Hindu worshippers , there can be nothing wrong in the one ’s accompanying the other inside the temple and subject to what we will state presently , the fact that the pilgrim , being a stranger to the spot , takes the assistance of the Panda in the matter of ‘ darshan ’ or worship of the deities or that the Panda gets remuneration from his client for the services he renders , does not in any way affect the legal rights of either of them . In law , it makes no difference whether one performs the act of worship himself or is aided or guided by another in the performance of them . If the Pandas claim any special right which is not enjoyed ordinarily by members of the Hindu public , they would undoubtedly have to establish such rights on the basis of custom , usage or otherwise .
