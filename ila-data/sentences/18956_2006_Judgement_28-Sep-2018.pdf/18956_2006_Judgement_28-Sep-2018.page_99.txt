This right of entry into a public temple is , however , not an unregulated or unrestricted right . It is open to the trustees of a public temple to regulate the time of public visits and fix certain hours of the day during which alone members of the public would be allowed access to the shrine . The public may also be denied access to certain particularly sacred parts of the temple , e.g. , the inner sanctuary or as it is said the ‘ Holy of Holies ’ where the deity is actually located . Quite apart from these , it is always competent to the temple authorities to make and enforce rules to ensure good order and decency of worship and prevent overcrowding in a temple . Good conduct or orderly behaviour is always an obligatory condition of admission into a temple [ Vide Kalidas Jivram v. Gor Parjaram , I.L.R. 15 Bom . p. 309 ; Thackeray v. Harbhum , I.L.R. 8 Bom . p. 432 ] , and this principle has been accepted by and recognised in the Shri Badrinath Temple Act , section 25 of which provides for framing of bye-laws by the temple committee inter alia for maintenance of order inside the temple and regulating the entry of persons within it [ Vide Section 25 ( 1 ) ( m ) ] . The true position , therefore , is that the plaintiffs ’ right of entering the temple along with their Yajmans is not a precarious or a permissive right depending for its existence upon the arbitrary discretion of the temple authorities ; it is a legal right in the true sense of the expression but it can be exercised subject to the restrictions which the temple committee may impose in good faith for maintenance of order and decorum within the temple and for ensuring proper performance of customary worship . In our opinion , the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration in this form . ” ( at pp. 860-862 )
