18 petitioners have pressed into service the judgment of this Court in Shirur Mutt ( supra ) , the relevant portion of which reads thus : “ We agree , however , with the High Court in the view taken by it about section 21 . This section empowers the Commissioner and his subordinate officers and also persons authorised by them to enter the premises of any religious institution or place of worship for the purpose of exercising any power conferred , or any duty imposed by or under the Act . It is well known that there could be no such thing as an unregulated and unrestricted right of entry in a public temple or other religious institution , for persons who are not connected with the spiritual functions thereof . It is a _ traditional custom universally observed not to allow access to any outsider to the particularly sacred parts of a temple as for example , the place where the deity is located . There are also fixed hours of worship and rest for the idol when no disturbance by any member of the public is allowed . Section 21 , it is to be noted , does not confine the right of entry to the outer portion of the premises ; it does not even exclude the inner sanctuary the Holy of Holies " as it is said , the sanctity of which is “ zealously preserved . It does not say that the entry may be made after due notice to the head of the institution and at such hours which would not interfere with the due observance of the rites and ceremonies in the institution . We think that as the section stands , it interferes with the fundamental rights of the Mathadhipati and the denomination of which he is head guaranteed under articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution . ” 25 . The judgment of this Court in Sri Venkatramana Devaru v. State of Mysore and others '' ! has been cited to submit that a religious denomination can not completely exclude or prohibit any " !
