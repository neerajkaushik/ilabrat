13.8 . The practise of restricting the entry of women belonging to the agegroup of 10 to 50 years , was challenged as being violative of Articles 15 , 25 , and 26 of the Constitution before a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court in S. Mahendran v . The Secretary , Travancore Devaswom Board , Thiruvanathapuram & Ors . ( supra ) . The Court held that the issue whether the practises were an integral part of the religion or not had to be decided on the basis of evidence . The High Court relied on the decision of this Court in Tilkayat Shri Govindalji Maharaj v. State of Rajasthan ( supra ) wherein it was held that the question whether the practise is religious in character , and whether it can be regarded as an integral or essential part of the religion , will depend upon the evidence adduced before a court , with respect to the tenets of the religion . The High Court held that the restriction on the entry of women between the ages of 10 to 50 years was in accordance with the practise prevalent since time immemorial , and was not violative of Articles 15 , 25 , and 26 of the Constitution . A religion can lay down a code of ethics , and also prescribe rituals , observances , ceremonies and modes of worship . These observances and rituals are also regarded as an integral part of religion . If the tenets of a religion lay down that certain ceremonies are to be performed at certain times in a particular manner , those ceremonies are matters of religion , and are to be protected as a religious belief . 61
