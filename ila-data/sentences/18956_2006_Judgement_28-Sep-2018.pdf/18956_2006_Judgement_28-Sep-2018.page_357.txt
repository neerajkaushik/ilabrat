( xvi ) The right of the devotees under Article 25 ( 1 ) can not be made subject to the claim of the Petitioners to enter the temple under Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution , since they do not profess faith in the deity of this Temple , but claim merely to be social activists . Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) declares that nothing in Article 25 ( 1 ) shall prevent the State from making any law providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus . The ‘ throwing open ’ to ‘ all classes and sections of Hindus ’ was intended to redress castebased prejudices and injustices in society . Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) can not be interpreted to mean that customs and usages forming an essential part of the religion , are to be overridden . Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) would have no application since there is no ban , but only a limited restriction during the notified period , based on faith , custom and belief , which has been observed since time immemorial . ( xvii ) The Respondents submitted that the plea of the Petitioners with reference to Article 17 , was wholly misconceived . The object and core of Article 17 was to prohibit untouchability based on ‘ caste ’ in the Hindu religion . No such caste-based or religion-based untouchability is practised at the Sabarimala Temple . The customs practised by the devotees at the Sabarimala Temple do not flow from any practise associated with untouchability under Article 17 . The custom is not based on any alleged impurity or disability . Hence , the contention was liable to be rejected . 21
