PART A Explanation | — The wearing and carrying of kirpans shall be deemed to be included in the profession of the Sikh religion . Explanation IIl _ — In sub-clause ( b ) of clause ( 2 ) , the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh , Jaina or Buddhist religion , and the reference to Hindu religious institutions shall be construed accordingly . ” In clause ( 1 ) , Article 25 protects the equal entitlement of all persons to a freedom of conscience and to freely profess , protect and propagate religion . By conferring this right on all persons , the Constitution emphasises the universal nature of the right . By all persons , the Constitution means exactly what it says : every individual in society without distinction of any kind whatsoever is entitled to the right . By speaking of an equal entitlement , the Constitution places every individual on an even platform . Having guaranteed equality before the law and the equal protection of laws in Article 14 , the draftspersons specifically continued the theme of an equal entitlement as an intrinsic element of the freedom of conscience and of the right to profess , practice and propagate religion . There are three defining features of clause ( 1 ) of Article 25 : firstly , the entitlement of all persons without exception , secondly , the recognition of an equal entitlement ; and thirdly , the recognition both of the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess , practice and propagate religion . The right under Article 25 ( 1 ) is evidently an individual right for , it is in the individual that a conscience inheres . Moreover , it is the individual who professes , practices and propagates religion . Freedom of religion in Article 25 ( 1 ) is a right which the Constitution recognises as dwelling in each individual or natural person .
