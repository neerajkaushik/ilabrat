Commonwealth .49 The original extract relied upon has _ been reproduced hereinbelow : “ S . It is sometimes suggested in discussions on the subject of freedom of religion that , though the civil government should not interfere with religious opinions , it nevertheless may deal as it pleases with any acts which are done in pursuance of religious belief without infringing the principle of freedom of religion .
