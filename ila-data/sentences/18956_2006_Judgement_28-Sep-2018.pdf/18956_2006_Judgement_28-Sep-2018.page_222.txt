PART F infringed upon the fundamental right to religion of the Petitioners , who were members of the Muslim Qureshi Community . The Petitioners claimed that these laws were violative of Article 25 of the Constitution as Muslims were compelled by their religion to sacrifice cows at Bakr-Id . The Court placed reliance upon Islamic religious texts to determine that the sacrificing of cows at Bakr-ld was not an essential practice for Muslims : “ 13 ... No reference is made in the petition to any particular Surah of the Holy Quran which , in terms , requires the sacrifice of a cow ... What the Holy book enjoins is that people should pray unto the Lord and make sacrifice ... It is therefore , optional for a Muslim to sacrifice a goat for one person or a cow or a camel for seven persons . It does not appear to be obligatory that a person must sacrifice a cow . The very fact of an option seems to run counter to the notion of an obligatory duty ... ” ( Emphasis supplied ) In response to the claim that Muslims had been sacrificing cows since time immemorial and that this practice was sanctioned by their religion and was therefore protected by Article 25 , the Court observed that : “ 413 ... It is part of the known history of India that the Moghul Emperor Babar saw the wisdom of prohibiting the slaughter of cows as and by way of religious sacrifice and directed his son Humayun to follow this example ... We have , however , no material on the record before us which will enable us to say , in the face of the foregoing facts , that the sacrifice of a cow on that day is an obligatory overt act for a Mussalman to exhibit his religious belief and idea . In the premises , it is not possible for us to uphold this claim of the petitioners . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 51
