PART K The learned Judge read in a statutory requirement for ‘ laws in force ’ under Article 13 ( 1 ) : “ 23 ... There can be no doubt that the personal laws are in force in a general sense ; they are in fact administered by the Courts in India in matters falling within their purview . But the expression “ laws in force ” is , in my opinion , used in Article 13 ( 1 ) not in that general sense . This expression refers to what may compendiously be described as statutory laws . There is no doubt that laws which are included in this expression must have been passed or made by a Legislature or other competent authority , and unless this test is satisfied it would not be legitimate to include in this expression the personal laws merely on the ground that they are administered by Courts in India . ” The learned Judges differed on whether ‘ laws in force ’ in Article 13 ( 1 ) read with Article 13 ( 3 ) ( b ) includes ‘ custom or usages ’ . The reasoning of the High Court in recording this conclusion merits a closer look . 94 In AK Gopalan v State of Madras , ' ? ” a seven judge Bench dealt with the constitutionality of the Preventive Detention Act 1950 . The majority upheld the Act on a disjunctive reading of the Articles in Part III of the Constitution .
