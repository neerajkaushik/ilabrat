light of this possible complication which may arise in some cases that this Court struck a note of caution in the case of The Durgah Committee Ajmer v. Syed Hussain Ali [ ( 1962 ) 1 SCR 383 , 411 ] , and observed that in order that the practices in question should be treated as a part of religion they must be regarded by the said religion as its essential and integral part ; otherwise even purely secular practices which are not an essential or an integral part of religion are apt to be clothed with a religious form and may make a claim for being treated as religious practices within the meaning of Art. 25 ( 1 ) . In this connection , it can not be ignored that what is protected under Arts. 25 ( 1 ) and 26 ( b ) respectively are the religious practices and the right to manage affairs in matters of religion . If the practice in question is purely secular or the affair which is controlled by the statute is essentially and absolutely secular in character , it can not be urged that Art. 25 ( 1 ) or Art. 26 ( b ) has been contravened . The protection is given to the practice of religion and to the denomination â€™s right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion . Therefore , whenever a claim is made on behalf of an individual citizen that the impugned statute contravenes his fundamental right to practise religion or a claim is made on behalf of the denomination that the fundamental right guaranteed to it to manage its own affairs in matters of religion is contravened , it is necessary to consider whether the practice in question is religious or the affairs in respect of which the right of management is alleged to have been contravened are affairs in matters of religion . If the practice is a religious practice or the affairs are the affairs in matter of religion , then , of course , the rights guaranteed by Art. 25 ( 1 ) and Art. 26 ( b ) can not be contravened . 33
