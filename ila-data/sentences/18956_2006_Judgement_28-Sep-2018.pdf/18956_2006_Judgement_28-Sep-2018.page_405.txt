He further states that Article 17 must be read with the Untouchability ( Offences ) Act , 1955 , which punishes offences committed in relation to a member of a Scheduled Caste .5 & Professor M.P. Jain also interprets Article 17 in a similar manner . He states : “ Therefore , treating of persons as untouchables either temporarily or otherwise for various reasons , e.g. , suffering from an epidemic or a contagious disease , or social observances associated with birth or death , or social boycott resulting from caste or other disputes do no come within the purview of Art. 17 . Art. 17 is concerned with those regarded untouchables in the course of historic developments . ” 59 It is clear that Article 17 refers to the practise of Untouchability as committed in the Hindu community against Harijans or people from depressed classes , and not women , as contended by the Petitioners .
