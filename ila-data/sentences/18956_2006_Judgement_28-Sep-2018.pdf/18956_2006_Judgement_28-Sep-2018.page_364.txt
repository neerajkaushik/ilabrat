In a pluralistic society comprising of people with diverse faiths , beliefs and traditions , to entertain PILs challenging religious practises followed by any group , sect or denomination , could cause serious damage to the Constitutional and secular fabric of this country . 8 . APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 14 IN MATTERS OF RELIGION AND RELIGIOUS PRACTISES 8.1 . 8.2 . Religious customs and practises can not be solely tested on the touchstone of Article 14 and the principles of rationality embedded therein . Article 25 specifically provides the equal entitlement of every individual to freely practise their religion . Equal treatment under Article 25 is conditioned by the essential beliefs and practises of any religion . Equality in matters of religion must be viewed in the context of the worshippers of the same faith . The twin-test for determining the validity of a classification under Article 14 is : e The classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia ; and e It must have a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the impugned law . The difficulty lies in applying the tests under Article 14 to religious practises which are also protected as Fundamental Rights under our Constitution . The right to equality claimed by the Petitioners under Article 14 conflicts with the rights of the worshippers of this shrine which is also a Fundamental Right 28
