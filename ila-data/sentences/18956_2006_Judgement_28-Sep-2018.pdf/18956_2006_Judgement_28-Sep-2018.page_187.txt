PART A that Article 26 has no connect with other freedoms or that the right of religious denominations is unconcerned with them .

But the absence of words of subjection does not necessarily attribute to the provision a status independent of a cluster of other entitlements , particularly those based on individual freedoms . Even where one provision is not subject to another there would still be a ground to read both together so that they exist in harmony . Constitutional interpretation is all about bringing a sense of equilibrium , a balance , so that read individually and together the provisions of the Constitution exist in contemporaneous accord .

In interpreting a segment of the Constitution devoted exclusively to fundamental rights one must eschew an approach which would result in asynchrony . Coexistence of freedoms is crucial , in the ultimate analysis , to a constitutional order which guarantees them and seeks to elevate them to a platform on which every individual without distinction can reap their fruit without a bar to access .
