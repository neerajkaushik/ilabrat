PART L respect of it ... [ Thus ] the deity as a juristic person has undoubtedly the right to institute a suit for the protection of its interest . ” 155 105 The word ‘ persons ’ in certain statutes have been interpreted to include idols . However , to claim that a deity is the bearer of constitutional rights is a distinct issue , and does not flow as a necessary consequence from the position of the deity as a juristic person for certain purposes . Merely because a deity has been granted limited rights as juristic persons under statutory law does not mean that the deity necessarily has constitutional rights . In Shirur Mutt , Justice B K Mukherjea writing for the Court , made observations on the bearer of the rights under Article 25 of the Constitution : “ 14 . We now come to Article 25 which , as its language indicates , secures to every person , subject to public order , health and morality , a freedom not only to entertain such religious belief , as may be approved of by his judgment and conscience , but also to exhibit his belief in such outward acts as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminate his ideas for the edification of others . A question is raised as to whether the word “ persons ” here means individuals only or includes corporate bodies as well .... Institutions , as such can not practise or propagate religion ; it can be done only by individual persons and whether these persons propagate their personal views or the tenets for which the institution stands is really immaterial for purposes of Article 25 . It is the propagation of belief that is protected , no matter whether the propagation takes place in a church or monastery , or in a temple or parlour meeting . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 153 B K Mukherjea “ The Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trust ” , at pages 257 , 264 147
