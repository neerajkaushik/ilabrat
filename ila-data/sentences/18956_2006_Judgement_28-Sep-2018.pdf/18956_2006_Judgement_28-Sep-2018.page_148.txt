of the activity test is to be applied . The Court should take a common sense view and be actuated by considerations of practical necessity . 21.7 . The exceptions to this individual right are public order , morality , and health . “ Public order ” is to be distinguished from “ law and order ” . “ Public disorder ” must affect the public at large as opposed to certain individuals . A disturbance of public order must cause a general disturbance of public tranquility . The term “ morality ” is difficult to define . For the present , suffice it to say that it refers to that which is considered abhorrent to civilized society , given the mores of the time , by reason of harm caused by way , inter alia , of exploitation or degradation . ” “ Health ” would include noise pollution and the control of disease . 21.8 . Another exception to the fundamental right conferred by Article 25 ( 1 ) is the rights that are conferred on others by the other provisions of Part III . This would show that if one were to propagate one ’s religion ° We were invited by the learned Amicus Curiae , Shri Raju Ramachandran , to read the word “ morality ” as being “ constitutional morality ’ as has been explained in some of our recent judgments . If so read , it can not be forgotten that this would bring in , through the back door , the other provisions of Part Ill of the Constitution , which Article 26 is not subject to , in contrast with Article 25 ( 1 ) . In any case , the fundamental right under Article 26 will have to be balanced with the rights of others contained in Part III as a matter of harmonious construction of these rights as was held in Sri Venkataramana Devaru ( supra ) . But this would only be on a case to case basis , without necessarily subjecting the fundamental right under Article 26 to other fundamental rights contained in Part Ill . 53
