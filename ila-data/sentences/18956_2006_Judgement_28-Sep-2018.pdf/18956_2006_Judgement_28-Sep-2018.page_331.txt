PART N 114 The Constitution protects the equal entitlement of all persons to a freedom of conscience and to freely profess , protect and propagate religion . Inhering in the right to religious freedom , is the equal entitlement of all persons , without exception , to profess , practice and propagate religion . Equal participation of women in exercising their right to religious freedom is a recognition of this right . In protecting religious freedom , the framers subjected the right to religious freedom to the overriding constitutional postulates of equality , liberty and personal freedom in Part III of the Constitution . The dignity of women can not be disassociated from the exercise of religious freedom . In the constitutional order of priorities , the right to religious freedom is to be exercised in a manner consonant with the vision underlying the provisions of Part Ill . The equal participation of women in worship inheres in the constitutional vision of a just social order . 115 The discourse of freedom in the Constitution can not be denuded of its context by construing an Article in Part III detached from the part within which it is situated . Even the right of a religious denomination to manage its own affairs in matters of religion can not be exercised in isolation from Part Ill of the Constitution . The primacy of the individual , is the thread that runs through the guarantee of rights . In being located in Part Ill of the Constitution , the exercise of denominational rights can not override and render meaningless constitutional protections which are informed by the overarching values of a liberal Constitution . 160
