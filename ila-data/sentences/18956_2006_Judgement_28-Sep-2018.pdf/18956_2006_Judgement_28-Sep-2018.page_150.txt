throw open all Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus . 21.11 . Contrasted with the fundamental right in Article 25 ( 1 ) is the fundamental right granted by Article 26 . This fundamental right is not granted to individuals but to religious denominations or sections thereof . A religious denomination or section thereof is to be determined on the basis of persons having a common faith , a common organization , and designated by a distinct name as a denomination or section thereof . Believers of a particular religion are to be distinguished from denominational worshippers . Thus , Hindu believers of the Shaivite and Vaishnavite form of worship are not denominational worshippers but part of the general Hindu religious form of worship . 21.12 . Four separate and distinct rights are given by Article 26 to religious denominations or sections thereof , namely : “ ( a ) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes ; ( b ) to manage its own affairs in matters of religion ; ( c ) to own and acquire movable and immovable property ; and ( d ) to administer such property in accordance with law . ” 55
