Thereafter , the applicant/intervenor has averred that the question whether Sabarimala is a denomination or not is irrelevant for the reason that even if it is concluded that Sabarimala is a denomination , it can claim protection of only essential practices under Article 26 ( b ) and denial of entry to women between the age of 10 to 50 years can not be said to be an essential aspect of the Hindu _ religion . Further , the applicant/intervenor has also averred that Sabarimala does not satisfy the test of religious denomination as laid down in S.P. Mittal ( supra ) . 62 . The applicant/intervenor has also submitted that the respondents , by referring to the practice as a custom with aberrations , have themselves suggested that there has been no continuity in the applicability of the said custom and that it has also been established in the evidence before the High Court that women irrespective of their age were permitted to enter the Sabarimala for the first rice feeding ceremony of their children
