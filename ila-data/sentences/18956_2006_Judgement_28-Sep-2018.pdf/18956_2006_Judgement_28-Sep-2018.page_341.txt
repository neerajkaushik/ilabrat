( vii ) Even if the Sabarimala Temple is taken to be a religious denomination , the restriction on the entry of women is not an essential religious practise . The prohibition on women between the ages of 10 to 50 years from entering the temple does not constitute the core foundation of the assumed religious denomination . Any law or custom to be protected under Article 26 must have Constitutional legitimacy . ( vii ) The exclusionary practise is violative of Article 21 , as it has the impact of casting a stigma on women as they are considered to be polluted , which has a huge psychological impact on them , and undermines their dignity under Article 21 . The exclusionary practise is violative of Article 17 as it is a direct form of “ Untouchability ” . Excluding women from public places such as temples , based on menstruation , is a form of ‘ untouchability ’ . This Article is enforceable both against non-State as well as State actors . ( viii ) Mr. Raju Ramachandran , learned Amicus Curiae , submitted that the Sabarimala Temple is a place of public worship . It is managed and administered by a statutory body i.e. the Travancore Devaswom Board . According to him , a public temple by its very character is established , and maintained for the benefit of its devotees . The right 3 ( 1964 ) 7 SCR 32 : AIR 1964 SC 1501 4 ( 1983 ) 1 SCC 51
