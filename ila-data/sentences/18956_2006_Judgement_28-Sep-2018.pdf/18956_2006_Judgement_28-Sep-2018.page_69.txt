69 108 . That apart , this Court , in Government of NCT of Delhi v. Union of India and others ? ° , observed thus : “ Constitutional morality in its strictest sense of the term implies strict and complete adherence to the constitutional principles as enshrined in various segments of the document . When a country is endowed with a Constitution , there is an accompanying promise which stipulates that every member of the country right from its citizens to the high constitutional functionaries must idolize the constitutional fundamentals . This duty imposed by the Constitution stems from the fact that the Constitution is the indispensable foundational base that functions as the guiding force to protect and ensure that the democratic setup promised to the citizenry remains unperturbed . ” 109 . Elaborating further , in Navtej Singh Johar and others v. Union of India and others ® ° , this Court observed : “ The concept of constitutional morality is not limited to the mere observance of the core principles of constitutionalism as the magnitude and sweep of constitutional morality is not confined to the provisions and literal text which a Constitution contains , rather it embraces within itself virtues of a wide magnitude such as that of ushering a pluralistic and inclusive society , while at the same time adhering to the other principles ’ of constitutionalism . It is further the result of embodying constitutional morality that the values of constitutionalism trickle down and percolate through the apparatus of the State for the betterment of each and every individual citizen of the State . ” > ( 2018 ) 8 SCALE 72 3 ° ( 2018 ) 10 SCALE 386
