PART F 40 In Sastri Yagnapurushadji v. Muldas Bhudardas Vaishya ® ( ‘“ Sastri Yagnapurushadji ” ) , a Constitution Bench of this Court was seized with the issue of whether the Swaminarayan sect could be exempted from the application of the Bombay Hindu Places of Public Worship ( Entry Authorization ) Act , 1956 , which allowed Dalits to worship in all temples to which the Act applied . The Petitioners , who were members of the Swaminarayan sect , contended that by virtue of being a non-Hindu creed , temples belonging to the sect did not fall within the ambit of the Act . Justice Gajendragadkar , writing for the Court , rejected this claim : “ 55 . It may be conceded that the genesis of the suit is the genuine apprehension entertained by the appellants , but as often happens in these matters the said apprehension is founded on _ superstition , ignorance and complete misunderstanding of the true teachings of Hindu religion and of the real significance of the tenets and philosophy taught by Swaminarayan himself . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) Quoting Tilak , Justice Gajendragadkar then expounded the distinctive features of Hinduism : “ 40 . Tilak faced this complex and difficult problem of defining or at least describing adequately Hindu religion and he evolved a working formula which may be regarded as fairly adequate and satisfactory . Said Tilak : " Acceptance of the Vedas with reverence ; recognition of the fact that the means or ways to salvation are diverse and realisation of the truth that the number of gods to be worshipped is large , that indeed is the distinguishing feature of Hindu religion . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 52 ( 1966 ) 3 SCR 242 59
