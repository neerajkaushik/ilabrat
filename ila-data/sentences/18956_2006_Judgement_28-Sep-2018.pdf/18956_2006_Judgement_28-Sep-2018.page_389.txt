This Temple owned vast landed properties from which the Temple was being maintained . These were taken over by the State , subject to the obligation to pay annuities to the Temple from the coffers of the State , as is evident from the Devaswom Proclamation ‘ ? dated 12t April 1922 issued by the Maharaja of Travancore , on which reliance was placed by Mr. J. Sai Deepak , Advocate . When the erstwhile State of Travancore merged with the Union of India , the obligation of paying annuities for the landed properties , was transferred to the Government of India . iv . The Temple is managed by the Travancore Devaswom Board . It does not receive funds from the Consolidated Fund of India , which would give it the character of ‘ State ’ or ‘ other authorities ’ under Article 12 of the Constitution . In any event , Article 290A does not in any manner take away the denominational character of the Sabarimala Temple , or the Fundamental Rights under Article 26 . 12.10 . The issue whether the Sabarimala Temple constitutes a ‘ religious denomination ’ , or a sect thereof , is a mixed question of fact and law . It is trite in law that a question of fact should not be decided in writ 46 Supra note 9 47 Annexure I , Written Submissions by J. Sai Deepak , learned Advocate on Behalf of K.K. Sabu ( Respondent No. 18 ) , and People for Dharma ( Intervenor ) . 53
