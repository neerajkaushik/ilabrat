32 leaves the house or the man resides elsewhere in order to separate himself from all family ties . Thereafter , the respondent no. 4 has pointed out that the problem with women is that they can not complete the 41 days Vruthum as their periods would eventually fall within the said period and it is a custom among all Hindus that women do not go to temples or participate in religious activities during periods and the same is substantiated by the statement of the basic Thantric text of temple worshipping in Kerala Thantra Samuchayam , Chapter 10 , Verse II . 45 . The respondent no. 4 has emphasized that the observance of 41 days Vruthum is a condition precedent for the pilgrimage which has been an age old custom and anyone who can not fulfill the said Vruthum can not enter the temple and , hence , women who have not attained puberty and those who are in menopause alone can undertake the pilgrimage at Sabarimala . The respondent no. 4 has also averred that the said condition of observance of 41days Vruthum is not applicable to women alone and even men who can not observe the 41 days Vruthum due to births and deaths in the family , which results in breaking of Vruthum , are also not allowed to take the pilgrimage that year .
