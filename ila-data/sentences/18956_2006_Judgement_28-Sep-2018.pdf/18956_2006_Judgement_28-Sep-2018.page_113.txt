be exercised by State agencies as the law provides . We may refer in this connection to the observation of Davar , J. in the case of Jamshed ji v. Soonabai [ 33 Bom . 122 ] , and although they were made in a case where the question was whether the bequest of property by a Parsi testator for the purpose of perpetual celebration of ceremonies like Muktad baj , Vyezashni , etc. , which are sanctioned by the Zoroastrian religion were valid charitable gifts , the observations , we think , are quite appropriate for our present purpose . “ If this is the belief of the community ” thus observed the learned Judge , “ and it is proved undoubtedly to be the belief of the Zoroastrian community , — a secular Judge is bound to accept that belief — it is not for him to sit in judgment on that belief , he has no right to interfere with the conscience of a donor who makes a gift in favour of what he believes to be the advancement of his religion and the welfare of his community or mankind ” . These observations do , in our opinion , afford an indication of the measure of protection that is given by Article 26 ( b ) of our Constitution . The distinction between matters of religion and those of secular administration of religious properties may , at times , appear to be a thin one . But in cases of doubt , as Chief Justice Latham pointed out in the case [ Vide Adelaide Company v . The Commonwealth , 67 C.L.R. 116 , 129 ] referred to above , the court should take a common sense view and be actuated by considerations of practical necessity . It is in the light of these principles that we will proceed to examine the different provisions of the Bombay Public Trusts Act , the validity of which has been challenged on behalf of the appellants . ” ( at pp. 1062-1066 )
