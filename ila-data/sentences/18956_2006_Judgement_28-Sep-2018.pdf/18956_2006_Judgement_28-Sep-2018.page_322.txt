PART M practice for the Muslim community . Durgah Committee ( 1962 ) , Tilkayat ( 1964 ) and Sastri Yagnapurushadji ( 1966 ) , Justice Gajendragadkar reserved to the court the authority to determine whether a practice was religious and , if it is , whether the practice can be regarded as essential or integral to religion . In Durgah Committee , Justice Gajendragadkar sought to justify the exercise of that adjudicatory function by stating that otherwise , practices which may have originated in “ merely superstitious beliefs ” and would , therefore , be “ extraneous and unessential accretions ” to religion would be treated as essential parts of religion . In Sastri Yagnapurushadji , Chief Justice Gajendragadkar propounded a view of Hinduism which in doctrinal terms segregates it from practices which could be isolated from a rational view of religion . The result which followed was that while at a formal level , the court continued to adopt a view which placed credence on the role of the community in deciding what constitutes a part of its religion , there is a super imposed adjudicatory role of the court which would determine as to whether something is essential or inessential to religion . In the case of the Avadhuta II , the assumption of this role by the Court came to the forefront in allowing it to reject a practice as not being essential , though it had been prescribed in a religious text by the founder of the sect . By reserving to itself the authority to determine practices which are essential or inessential to religion , the Court assumed a reformatory role which would allow it to cleanse religion of practices which were derogatory to individual dignity . 151
