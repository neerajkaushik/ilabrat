class or section for all times . All that a religious denomination may do is to restrict the entry of a particular class or section in certain rituals . The relevant portion of Devaru ( supra ) reads as under : “ We have held that the right of a denomination to wholly exclude members of the public from worshipping in the temple , though comprised in Art. 26 ( b ) , must yield to the overriding right declared by Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) in favour of the public to enter into a temple for worship . But where the right claimed is not one of general and total exclusion of the public from worship in the temple at all times but of exclusion from certain religious services , they being limited by the rules of the foundation to the members of the denomination , , then the question is not whether Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) over-rides that right so as to extinguish it , but whether it is possible-so to regulate the rights of the persons protected by Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) as to give effect to both the rights . If the denominational rights are such that to give effect to them would substantially reduce the right conferred by Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) , then of course , on our conclusion that Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) prevails as against Art. 26 ( b ) , the denominational rights must vanish . But where that is not the position , and after giving effect to the rights of the denomination what is left to the public of the right of worship is something substantial and not merely the husk of it , there is no reason why we should not so construe Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) as to give effect to Art. 26 ( b ) and recognise the rights of the denomination in respect of matters which are strictly denominational , leaving the rights of the public in other respects unaffected . ” ( Emphasis is ours )
