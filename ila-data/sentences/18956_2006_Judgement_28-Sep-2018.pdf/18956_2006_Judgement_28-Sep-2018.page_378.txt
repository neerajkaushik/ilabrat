10.9 . 10.10 . 10.11 . legislation . What is permitted by Article 25 ( 2 ) is State made law on the grounds specified therein , and not judicial intervention . In the present case , the 1965 Act is a legislation framed in pursuance of Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) which provides for the throwing open of Hindu places of public worship . The proviso to Section 3 of the 1965 Act carves out an exception to the applicability of the general rule contained in Section 3 , with respect to religious denominations , or sect ( s ) thereof , so as to protect their right to manage their religious affairs without outside interference . Rule 3 ( b ) gives effect to the proviso of Section 3 insofar as it makes a provision for restricting the entry of women at such times when they are not by custom or usage allowed to enter of place of public worship . The Respondents claim the right to worship in the Sabarimala Temple under Article 25 ( 1 ) in accordance with their beliefs and practises as per the tenets of their religion . These practises are considered to be essential or integral to that Temple . Any interference with the same would conflict with their right guaranteed by Article 25 ( 1 ) to worship Lord Ayyappa in the form of a â€˜ Naishtik Brahmacharv . In other jurisdictions also , where State made laws were challenged on grounds of public morality , the Courts have refrained from striking down the same on the ground that it is beyond the ken of the Courts . 42
