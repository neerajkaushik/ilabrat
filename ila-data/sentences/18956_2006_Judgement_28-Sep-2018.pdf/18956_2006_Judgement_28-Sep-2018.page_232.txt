In a view similar to that taken by Justice Gajendragadkar in Tilkayat , the Court cautioned against extending constitutional protection to purely secular practices clothed with a religious form : “ 28 ... Sometimes , practices , religious or secular , are inextricably mixed up . This is more particularly so in regard to Hindu religion because under the provisions of the ancient Smriti , human actions from birth to death and most of the individual actions from day-today are regarded as religious in character in one facet or the other .
