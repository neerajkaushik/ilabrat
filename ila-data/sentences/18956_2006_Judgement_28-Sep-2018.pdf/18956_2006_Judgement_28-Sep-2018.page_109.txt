“ Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees to every person and not merely to the citizens of India the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess , practise and propagate religion . This is subject , in every case , to public order , health and morality . Further exceptions are engrafted upon this right by clause ( 2 ) of the Article . Sub-clause ( a ) of clause ( 2 ) saves the power of the State to make laws regulating or restricting any economic , financial , political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice ; and subclause ( b ) reserves the State ’s power to make laws providing for social reform and social welfare even though they might interfere with religious practices . Thus , subject to the restrictions which this Article imposes , every person has a fundamental right under our Constitution not merely to entertain such religious belief as may be approved of by his judgment or conscience but to exhibit his belief and ideas in such overt acts as are enjoined or sanctioned by his religion and further to propagate his religious views for the edification of others . It is immaterial also whether the propagation is made by a person in his individual capacity or on behalf of any church or institution . The free exercise of religion by which is meant the performance of outward acts in pursuance of religious belief , is , as stated above , subject to State requlation imposed to secure order , public health and morals of the people . What sub-clause ( a ) of clause ( 2 ) of Article 25 contemplates is not State regulation of the religious practices as such which are protected unless they run counter to public health or morality but of activities which are really of an economic , commercial or political character though they are associated with religious practices . So far as Article 26 is concerned , it deals with a particular aspect of the subject of religious freedom . 14
