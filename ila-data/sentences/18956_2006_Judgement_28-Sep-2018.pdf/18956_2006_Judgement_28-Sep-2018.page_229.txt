PART F In this regard , the Court noted that : “ 58 ... What is protected under Articles 25 ( 1 ) and 26 ( b ) respectively are the religious practices and the right to manage affairs in matters of religion . If the practice in question is purely secular or the affair which is controlled by the statute is essentially and absolutely secular in character , it can not be urged that Article 25 ( 1 ) or Article 26 ( b ) has been contravened . ” Tilkayat set forth an important qualification to the proposition laid down in Shirur Mutt , which held that adherents themselves must be allowed to determine what was essential to their religion . The Court observed that where ‘ conflicting evidence is produced in respect of rival contentions as to competing religious practices , ’ a ‘ blind application ’ of the Shirur Mutt formula may not resolve a dispute , because persons within a community may have diverse and contrasting conceptions of what is essential to their religion . It was therefore held to be incumbent upon the Court to determine not only whether a practice was religious in character , but also whether it could be considered an essential part of religion . Beginning with the Shirur Mutt formulation that what is essential to religion would be determined by the adherents to the faith , the Court moved towards a doctrine that what is essential “ will always have to be decided by the Court . ” In fact , the Court would determine whether a statute sought to regulate what is “ essentially and absolutely secular . ” What is religious and what is secular and the boundaries of both were then to be adjudicated by the Court . 58
