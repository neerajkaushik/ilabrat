PART A prevail . While the Constitution recognises religious beliefs and faiths , its purpose is to ensure a wider acceptance of human dignity and liberty as the ultimate founding faith of the fundamental text of our governance .

Making a provision subject to another may indicate that the former is controlled by or is subordinate to the other . In making clause 1 of Article 25 subject to the other provisions of Part III without introducing a similar limitation in Article 26 , the Constitution should not readily be assumed to have intended the same result . Evidently the individual right under Article 25 ( 1 ) is not only subject to public order , morality and health , but it is also subordinate to the other freedoms that are guaranteed by Part Ill . In omitting the additional stipulation in Article 26 , the Constitution has consciously not used words that would indicate an intent specifically to make Article 26 subordinate to the other freedoms .
