" ( Emphasis is ours ) 121 . In Commissioner of Police and others v. Acharya Jagadishwarananda Avadhuta and others ( supra ) , being the second Ananda Marga case , the Court has elaborately discussed the true nature of an essential practice and has further laid down the test for determining whether a certain practice can be characterized as essential to a particular religion in order to guarantee protection under the Constitution . The Court has opined : " The protection guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution is not confined to matters of doctrine or belief but extends to acts done in pursuance of religion and , therefore , contains a guarantee for rituals , observances , ceremonies and modes of worship which are essential or integral part of religion . What constitutes an integral or essential part of religion has to be determined with reference to its doctrines , practices , tenets , historical background etc. of the given religion .
