49 been led by the respondents herein to demonstrate that the exclusion of women is an essential part of their religion . 76 . After referring to Section 3 of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship ( Authorization of Entry ) Act , 1965 which makes a place of worship open to all sections and classes , Mr. Raju Ramchandran , learned senior counsel , is of the view that the said Section is nothing but a statutory enunciation of rights embodied under Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) and similarly , the emphasis on the word ‘ ike ’ in Section 3 is the statutory reflection of the phrase ‘ equally ’ found in Article 25 ( 1 ) . That apart , it is the case of the learned Amicus curiae that the expression ‘ section ’ or ‘ class ’ in Section 2 ( c ) of the 1965 Act must necessarily include all sexes if Section 3 is to be in consonance with a woman ’s right to worship under Article 25 and in consonance with Article 15 . As per the learned Amicus , women between the age of 10 to 50 years are a section or class of Hindus who are within the inclusive provision of Section 3 and the proviso to Section 3 brings in the right conferred in Article 26 , for the inter-play between Section 3 and the proviso must be governed by how Articles 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) and 26 are reconciled by the judgment of this Court in Devaru ( supra ) .
