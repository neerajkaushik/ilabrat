78 religion and whether the nature of Hindu religion would be altered without the said exclusionary practice . The answer to these questions , in our considered opinion , is in the firm negative . In no scenario , it can be said that exclusion of women of any age group could be regarded as an essential practice of Hindu religion and on the contrary , it is an essential part of the Hindu religion to allow Hindu women to enter into a temple as devotees and followers of Hindu religion and offer their prayers to the deity . In the absence of any scriptural or textual evidence , we can not accord to the exclusionary practice followed at the Sabarimala temple the status of an essential practice of Hindu religion . 123 . By allowing women to enter into the Sabarimala temple for offering prayers , it can not be imagined that the nature of Hindu religion would be fundamentally altered or changed in any manner . Therefore , the exclusionary practice , which has been given the backing of a subordinate legislation in the form of Rule 3 ( b ) of the 1965 Rules , framed by the virtue of the 1965 Act , is neither an essential nor an integral part of the Hindu religion without which Hindu religion , of which the devotees of Lord Ayyappa are followers , will not survive .
