PART H consideration of the evidence , we see no grounds for differing from the finding given by the learned Judges in the court below that the suit temple is a denominational temple founded for the benefit of the Gowda Saraswath Brahmins ... ” The dedication of the temple was for the Gowda Saraswath Brahmins specifically . The temple was not dedicated for followers of all communities . 62 . In SP Mittal v Union of India ( “ Mittal ” ) ** , Justice Ranganath Misra who delivered the opinion of the Court , held that the followers of Sri Aurobindo do not constitute a religious denomination . The Court formulated the conditions necessary to be fulfilled to qualify as ‘ religious denomination ’ : “ 80 . The words “ religious denomination ” in Article 26 of the Constitution must take their colour from the word “ religion ” and if this be so , the expression “ religious denomination ” must also satisfy three conditions : “ ( 1 ) It must be a collection of individuals who have a system of beliefs or doctrines which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well-being , that is , a common faith ; ( 2 ) common organisation ; and ( 3 ) designation by a distinctive name . ” ® ° These tests , as we have seen , are a re-statement of the Shirur Mutt formulation . The Court dwelt on the organisation and activities of the Aurobindo Society and emphasised that a collective seeking the status of a religious denomination must be a religious institution : 58 1983 1 SCC 51 59 Ibid , at page 85 81
