PART A of women from worship in a public temple ? Will the quest for equality and fraternity be denuded of its content where women continue to be treated as children of a lesser god in exercising their liberties in matters of belief , faith and worship ? Will the pursuit of individual dignity be capable of being achieved if we deny to women equal rights in matters of faith and worship , on the basis of a physiological aspect of their existence ? These questions are central to understanding the purpose of the Constitution , as they are to defining the role which is ascribed to the Constitution in controlling the closed boundaries of organised religion . 6 The chapter on Fundamental Rights encompasses the rights to ( i ) Equality ( Articles 14 to 18 ) ; ( ii ) Freedom ( Articles 19 to 24 ) ; ( iii ) Freedom of religion ( Articles 25 to 28 ) ; ( iv ) Cultural and educational rights ( Articles 29 and 30 ) ; and ( v ) Constitutional remedies ( Article 32 ) . Article 25 provides thus : “ 25 . ( 1 ) Subject to public order , morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part , all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess , practise and propagate religion . ( 2 ) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State from making any law — ( a ) regulating or restricting any economic , financial , political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice ; ( b ) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus .
