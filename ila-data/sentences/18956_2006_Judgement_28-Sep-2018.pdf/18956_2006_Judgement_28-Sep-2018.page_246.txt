PART G 54 The Court must lean against granting constitutional protection to a claim which derogates from the dignity of women as equal holders of rights and protections . In the ethos of the Constitution , it is inconceivable that age could found a rational basis to condition the right to worship . The ages of ten to fifty have been marked out for exclusion on the ground that women in that age group are likely to be in the procreative age . Does the Constitution permit this as basis to exclude women from worship ? Does the fact that a woman has a physiological feature — of being in a menstruating age — entitle anybody or a group to subject her to exclusion from religious worship ? The physiological features of a woman have no significance to her equal entitlements under the Constitution . All women in the age group of ten and fifty may not in any case fall in the ‘ procreative age group ’ . But that to my mind is again not a matter of substance . The heart of the matter lies in the ability of the Constitution to assert that the exclusion of women from worship is incompatible with dignity , destructive of liberty and a denial of the equality of all human beings . These constitutional values stand above everything else as a principle which brooks no exceptions , even when confronted with a claim of religious belief . To exclude women is derogatory to an equal citizenship . 55 The Respondents submitted that the deity at Sabarimala is in the form of a Naishtika Brahmacharya : Lord Ayyappa is celibate .
