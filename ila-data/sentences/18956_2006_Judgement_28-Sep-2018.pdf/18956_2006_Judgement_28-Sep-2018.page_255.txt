PART H in Tamil Nadu does not constitute a religious denomination . Justice Shivraj Patil emphasised that the common faith of the community must find its basis in “ religion ” : “ 7 . It is settled position in law , having regard to the various decisions of this Court that the words “ religious denomination ” take their colour from the word “ religion ” . The expression “ religious denomination ” must satisfy three requirements : ( 1 ) it must be a collection of individuals who have a system of belief or doctrine which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well-being i.e. a common faith ; ( 2 ) a common organisation ; and ( 3 ) designation of a distinctive name . It necessarily follows that the common faith of the community should be based on religion and in that they should have common religious tenets and the basic cord which connects them , should be religion and not merely considerations of caste or community or societal status ... ” ( Emphasis supplied ) Though formulated as a three-pronged test , a fourth element emerges from the narrative . That is the position of a common set of religious tenets . Religion is what binds a religious denomination . Caste , community and social status do not bring into being a religious denomination . 64 These precedents indicate the ingredients which must be present for a set of individuals to be regarded as a religious denomination . These are a common faith , acommon organisation and a distinctive name brought together under the rubric of religion . A common thread which runs through them is the requirement of a religious identity , which is fundamental to the character of a religious denomination . 56 Ibid , at page 716 84
