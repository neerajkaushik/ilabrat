PART L Practices , that perpetuate discrimination on the grounds of characteristics that have historically been the basis of discrimination , must not be viewed as part of a seemingly neutral legal background . They have to be used as intrinsic to , and not extraneous to , the interpretive enquiry . The case before us has raised the question of whether it is constitutionally permissible to exclude women between the ages of ten and fifty from the Sabarimala Temple . In the denial of equal access , the practice denies an equal citizenship and substantive equality under the Constitution . The primacy of individual dignity is the wind in the sails of the boat chartered on the constitutional course of a just and egalitarian social order . L Deity as a bearer of constitutional rights 103 Mr J Sai Deepak , learned Counsel , urged that the presiding deity of the Sabarimala Temple , Lord Ayyappa , is a bearer of constitutional rights under Part Ill of the Constitution . It was submitted that the right to preserve the celibacy of the deity is a protected constitutional right and extends to excluding women from entering and praying at the Sabarimala Temple . It was urged that the right of the deity to follow his Dharma flows from Article 25 ( 1 ) and Article 26 of the Constitution and any alteration in the practice followed would have an adverse effect on the fundamental rights of the deity . 145
