PART M even the religious freedom of a denomination is subject to an anti-exclusion principle : “ the anti-exclusion principle holds that the external norm of constitutional anti-discrimination be applied to limit the autonomy of religious groups in situations where these groups are blocking access to basic goods . ” The anti-exclusion principle stipulates thus : “ \ . . that the state and the Court must respect the integrity of religious group life ( and thereby treat the internal point of religious adherents as determinative of the form and content of religious practices ) except where the practices in question lead to the exclusion of individuals from economic , social or cultural life in a manner that impairs their dignity , or hampers their access to basic goods . ” 1 ® 112 The anti-exclusion principle allows for due-deference to the ability of a religion to determine its own religious tenets and doctrines . At the same time , the anti-exclusion principle postulates that where a religious practice causes the exclusion of individuals in a manner which impairs their dignity or hampers their access to basic goods , the freedom of religion must give way to the over-arching values of a liberal constitution . The essential religious practices test should merit a close look , again for the above reasons , in an appropriate case in the future . For the present , this judgment has decided the issues raised on the law as it stands . 164 Gautam Bhatia , Freedom from community : Individual rights , group life , state authority and religious freedom under the Indian Constitution , Global Constitutionalism , Cambridge University Press ( 2016 ) at page 374 165 Gautam Bhatia , Freedom from community : Individual rights , group life , state authority and religious freedom under the Indian Constitution , Global Constitutionalism , Cambridge University Press ( 2016 ) at page 382 158
