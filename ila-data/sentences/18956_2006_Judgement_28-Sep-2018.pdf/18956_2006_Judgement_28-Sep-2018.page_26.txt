Referring to the judgment of this Court in Devaru ( supra ) , the applicant/intervenor has submitted that the right to manage its own affairs conferred upon a religious denomination under Article 26 ( b ) is subject to be rights guaranteed to Hindu women under Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) . As per the applicant/intervenor , a harmonious construction of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution reveals that neither Article 26 enables the State to make a law excluding any women from the right to worship in any public temple nor does it protect any custom that discriminates against women and , thus , such exclusion amounts to destruction of the rights of women to practise religion guaranteed under Article 25 . 38 . The applicant/intervenor has also drawn the attention of this Court to the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) and the fact that India is a party to this Convention for emphasizing that it is the obligation of the State to eradicate taboos relating to menstruation based on customs or traditions and further the State should refrain from invoking the plea of custom or tradition to avoid their obligation .
