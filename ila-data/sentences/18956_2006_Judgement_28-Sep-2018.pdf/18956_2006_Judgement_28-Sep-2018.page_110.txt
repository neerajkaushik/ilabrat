Under this article , any religious denomination or a section of it has the guaranteed right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes and to manage in its own way all affairs in matters of religion . Rights are also given to such denomination or a section of it to acquire and own movable and immovable properties and _ to administer such properties in accordance with law . The language of the two clauses ( b ) and ( d ) of Article 26 would at once bring out the difference between the two . In regard to affairs in matters of religion , the right of management given to a religious body is a guaranteed fundamental right which no legislation can take away . On the other hand , as regards administration of property which a religious denomination is entitled to own and acquire , it has undoubtedly the right to administer such property but only in accordance with law . This means that the State can regulate the administration of trust properties by means of laws validly enacted ; but here again it should be remembered that under Article 26 ( d ) , it is the religious denomination itself which has been given the right to administer its property in accordance with any law which the State may validly impose . A law , which takes away the right of administration altogether from the religious denomination and vests it in any other or secular authority , would amount to violation of the right which is guaranteed by Article 26 ( d ) of the Constitution . The moot point for consideration , therefore , is where is the line to be drawn between what are matters of religion and what are not ? Our Constitution-makers have made no attempt to define what ‘ religion ’ is and it is certainly not possible to frame an exhaustive definition of the word ‘ religion ’ which would be applicable to all classes of persons .
