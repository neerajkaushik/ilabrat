and appropriate to the worship of the particular deity could be engaged as an Archaka . If traditionally or conventionally , in any temple , all along a Brahmin alone was conducting poojas or performing the job of Santhikaran , it may not be because a person other than the Brahmin is prohibited from doing so because he is not a Brahmin , but those others were not in a position and , as a matter of fact , were prohibited from learning , reciting or mastering Vedic literature , rites or performance of rituals and wearing sacred thread by getting initiated into the order and thereby acquire the right to perform homa and ritualistic forms of worship in public or private temples . Consequently , there is no justification to insist that a Brahmin or Malayala Brahmin in this case , alone can perform the rites and rituals in the temple , as part of the rights and freedom guaranteed under Article 25 of the Constitution and further claim that any deviation would tantamount to violation of any such guarantee under the Constitution . There can be no claim based upon Article 26 so far as the Temple under our consideration is concerned . Apart from this principle enunciated above , as long as anyone well versed and properly trained and qualified to perform the pooja in a manner conducive and appropriate to the worship of the particular deity , is appointed as Santhikaran dehors his pedigree based on caste , no valid or legally justifiable grievance can be made in a court of law . There has been no proper plea or sufficient proof also in this case of any specific custom or usage specially created by the founder of the Temple or those who have the exclusive right to administer the affairs â€” religious or secular of the Temple in question , leave alone the _ legality , propriety and validity of the same in the changed legal position brought about by the Constitution and the law enacted by Parliament . The Temple also does not belong to any denominational category 46
