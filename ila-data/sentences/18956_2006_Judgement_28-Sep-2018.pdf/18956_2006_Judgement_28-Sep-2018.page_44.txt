worship where members of the public are admitted as a matter of right and entry thereto is not restricted to any particular denomination or part thereof . As per the learned Amicus , the public character of the temple gives birth to the right of the devotees to enter it for the purpose of darshan or worship and this universal right to entry is not a permissive right dependent upon the temple authorities but a legal right in the true sense of the expression . To advance this view , the learned Amicus has relied upon the decisions of this Court in Deoki Nandan uv . Murlidhar and others ? and Sri Radhakanta Deb and another v. Commissioner of Hindu Religious Endowments , Orissa â€™ . 68 . As regards the nature of the right claimed by the petitioners herein , learned Senior Advocate , Mr. Raju Ramchandran , the learned Amicus , has submitted that it is the freedom of conscience and the right to practise and profess their religion which is recognized under Article 25 of the Constitution of India . This right , as per the learned Amicus , encompasses the liberty of belief , faith and worship , pithily declared as a constitutional vision in the Preamble to the Constitution of India . 3 AIR 1957 SC 133 4 ( 1981 ) 2 SCC 226
