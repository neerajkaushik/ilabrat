8.3 . 8.4 . 8.5 . guaranteed by Articles 25 , and 26 of the Constitution . It would compel the Court to undertake judicial review under Article 14 to delineate the rationality of the religious beliefs or practises , which would be outside the ken of the Courts . It is not for the courts to determine which of these practises of a faith are to be struck down , except if they are pernicious , oppressive , or a social evil , like Sati . The submissions made by the Counsel for the Petitioners is premised on the view that this practise constitutes gender discrimination against women . On the other hand , the Respondents submit that the present case deals with the right of the devotees of this denomination or sect , as the case may be , to practise their religion in accordance with the tenets and beliefs , which are considered to be “ essential ” religious practises of this shrine . The Petitioners and Intervenors have contended that the age group of 10 to 50 years is arbitrary , and can not stand the rigours of Article 14 . This submission can not be accepted , since the prescription of this age-band is the only practical way of ensuring that the limited restriction on the entry of women is adhered to . The right to gender equality to offer worship to Lord Ayyappa is protected by permitting women of all ages , to visit temples where he has not manifested himself in the form of a ‘ Naishtik Brahamachar ? ’ , and there is no similar restriction in those temples . It is pertinent to mention that the Respondents , in this context , have submitted that there are over 1000 temples of Lord Ayyappa , where he has manifested in other forms , and this restriction does not apply . 29
