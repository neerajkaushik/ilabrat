The important question that then had to be decided was whether denominational institutions were within the reach of Article 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) . This was answered in the affirmative . It was then stated : S eeaee The fact is that though Art. 25 ( 1 ) deals with rights of individuals , Art. 25 ( 2 ) is much wider in its contents and has reference to the rights of communities , and controls both Art. 25 ( 1 ) and Art. 26 ( b ) . The result then is that there are two provisions of equal authority , neither of them being subject to the other . The question is how the apparent conflict between them is to be resolved . The rule of construction is well settled that when there are in an enactment two provisions which can not be reconciled with each other , they should be so interpreted that , if possible , effect could be given to both . This is what is known as the rule of harmonious construction . Applying this rule , if the contention of the appellants is to be accepted , then Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) will become wholly nugatory in its application to denominational temples , though , as stated above , the language of that Article includes them . On the other hand , if the contention of the respondents is accepted , then full effect can be given to Art. 26 ( b ) in all matters of religion , subject only to this that as regards one aspect of them , entry into a temple for worship , the rights declared under Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) will prevail . While , in the former case , Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) will be put wholly out of operation , in the latter , effect can be given to both that provision and Art. 26 ( b ) . We must accordingly hold that Art. 26 ( b ) must be read subject to Art. 25 ( 2 ) ( b ) . ‚Äù ( at pp. 917-918 )
