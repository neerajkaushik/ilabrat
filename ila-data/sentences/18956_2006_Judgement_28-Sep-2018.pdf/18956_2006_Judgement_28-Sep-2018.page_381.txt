The concept of Constitutional Morality refers to the moral values underpinning the text of the Constitution , which are instructive in ascertaining the true meaning of the Constitution , and achieve the objects contemplated therein . Constitutional Morality in a pluralistic society and secular polity would reflect that the followers of various sects have the freedom to practise their faith in accordance with the tenets of their religion . It is irrelevant whether the practise is rational or logical . Notions of rationality can not be invoked in matters of religion by courts . The followers of this denomination , or sect , as the case may be , submit that the worshippers of this deity in Sabarimala Temple even individually have the right to practise and profess their religion under Article 25 ( 1 ) in accordance with the tenets of their faith , which is protected as a Fundamental Right . Equality and non-discrimination are certainly one facet of Constitutional Morality . However , the concept of equality and nondiscrimination in matters of religion can not be viewed in isolation . Under our Constitutional scheme , a balance is required to be struck between the principles of equality and non-discrimination on the one hand , and the protection of the cherished liberties of faith , belief , and worship guaranteed by Articles 25 and 26 to persons belonging to all religions in a secular polity , on the other hand . Constitutional morality requires the harmonisation or balancing of all such rights , to ensure that the religious beliefs of none are obliterated or undermined . 45
