13 . The counsels for the accused-respondents have strongly 14 . supported the judgment of the High Court wherein it was held that , since the present matters deal with “ manufactured drugs ” the present respondents should be tried for the violation of provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act , 1940 . However , we are unable to agree on the conclusion reached by the High Court for reasons stated further . First , we note that Section 80 of the N.D.P.S Act , clearly lays down that application of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is not barred , and provisions of N.D.P.S. Act can be applicable in addition to that of the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act . The statute further clarifies that the provisions of the N.D.P.S Act are not in derogation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act , 1940 . This Court in the case of Union of India vs. Sanjeev V. Deshpande ( supra ) , has held that , “ 35 . ... essentially the Drugs & Cosmetics Act , 1940 deals with various operations of manufacture , sale , purchase etc. of drugs generally whereas Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act , 1985 deals with a more specific class of drugs and , therefore , a special law on the subject . Further the provisions of the Act operate in addition to the provisions of 1940 Act . ” 15
