movement of Nifty options in the F & O segment should be in harmony with the movement of Nifty index in the cash segment . This assumption is fallacious and we can not agree . Movement of index in the cash segment does influence the index options in the F & O segment because the strike rate is directly linked with the index value in the cash segment . However , the converse is not always true . While transactions in the cash market are based on the current market price of the underlying derived by the principle of demand and supply and in the case of an index , the value depends on the performance of the stocks that constitute it , the pricing in the F & O segment is based on future expected events which may or may not happen . Anticipated future events may not have a discernible effect on the cash segment today where delivery of shares is given/taken immediately . Such events may have a great impact on perceptions in the F & O market where the investor holds an open position and a continuous liability during the currency of the contract which is generally for one to three months with anticipation of future events which are always pregnant with all sorts of possibilities . Again , volatility and potential for greater losses may trigger movements in the F & O market without any equivalent cash market movements . Further , the cash market may move up today but the prediction for the F & O market could be that at the end of a month , two months or three months the market may move down . Only short term 26
