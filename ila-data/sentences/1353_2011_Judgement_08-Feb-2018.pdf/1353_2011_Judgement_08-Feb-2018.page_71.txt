a high price to the party-Kasam Holding Pvt. Ltd. and the same quantity being reversed by Kasam Holding Pvt. Ltd. to the same party-Rakhi Trading Pvt. Ltd. at a low price through the same set of brokers . As discussed earlier , during March , 2007 thirteen Nifty Option Contracts got matched between the same parties through the same brokers . | fail to understand as to why Kasam Holding has made the transactions repeatedly by incurring losses . It seems improbable that Kasam Holding which was facing loss in each transaction by trading with the respondent , was still eager to trade with the same repeatedly for about four days which is not in consonance with the market trend and human conduct ; more so , when there has not been any major difference in the underlying price . It is thus difficult to accept that several such sell and buy orders between the respondent and Kasam Holding being within a gap of " 1 " , " 2 " or " 3 " or few seconds were by mere coincidence . As contended by the appellant-SEBI , it was too much of coincidence that there were number of transactions of ' buy and sell orders ' between the same parties with same quantity of stock with significant variation in price . 71
