synchronized trades have been entered into for the purposes of tax planning , such trade could be held objectionable only if they have resulted in influencing the market in one way or other . For its finding that every person is entitled to arrange his affairs as to avoid taxation , SAT relied upon Viram Investment Pvt. Ltd. and Ors . v. Securities and Exchange Board of India ( MANU/SB/0046 / 2005 ) decided on 11.02.2005 . Contention of the respondents is that transactions which have been entered into with a view to achieve tax planning are not illegal and respondents placed reliance upon Viram Investment Pvt. Ltd. case . The learned counsel for SEBI contended that the market can not be manipulated by fictitious transactions either for tax planning or for some ulterior purposes like money laundering etc . 45 . No grounds have been raised in the show cause notice alleging that the impugned fictitious transactions have been entered into with a view to avoid payment of tax and was an act of tax planning . Adjudicating officer also has not gone into this aspect . Hence , | am not inclined to go into this aspect , whether the impugned transactions were intended to reduce the brunt of taxation and an act of tax planning . The correctness of findings of SAT in the case of Viram Investment Pvt. Ltd. is left open . 89
