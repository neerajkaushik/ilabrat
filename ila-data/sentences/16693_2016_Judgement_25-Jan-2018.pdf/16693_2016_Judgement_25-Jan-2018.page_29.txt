In view of the foregoing discussion , we allow the appeals filed by the State , set aside the impugned judgment and the award of the Reference Court ( Civil Courts ) and remand the cases to the Reference Court for deciding all reference cases afresh on merits keeping in view our observations made supra . 44 . Parties would be at liberty to adduce additional evidence in support of their respective stand both oral and documentary .
