which provides that the Indian Medical Register that is required to be maintained by the Medical Council of India shall contain the name of persons who are for the time being enrolled in the State Medical Register and who possess any of the recognised medical qualifications . These provisions contemplate that a person can practise in allopathic system of medicine in a State or in the country only if he possesses a recognised medical qualification . Permitting a person who does not possess the recognised medical qualification in the allopathic system of medicine would be in direct conflict with the provisions of the Central Act . We are , therefore , of the view that the first proviso to Section 38 of the State Act insofar as it empowers the State Government to permit a person to practise allopathic system of medicine even though he does not possess the recognised medical qualifications for that system of medicine is inconsistent with the provisions of Sections 15 and 21 read with Sections 11 to 14 of the Central Act . The said proviso suffers from the vice of repugnancy insofar as it covers persons who want to practise the allopathic system of medicine and is void to the extent of such repugnancy . Practitioners in allopathic system of medicine must , therefore , be excluded from the scope of the first proviso and it must be confined in its application to systems of medicines other than the allopathic system of medicine . We , however , wish to make it clear that we have not considered the impact of the provisions contained in the Indian Medicine Central Council Act , 1970 and the Homoeopathy Central Council Act , 1973 on the provisions of the said proviso to Section 38 of the State Act . ‚Äù Even though the impact of the provisions of the IMCC Act was not considered but the provision of Section 17 of the IMCC Act also provides for recognition of medical qualification included in Second , Third and Fourth Schedules to be _ sufficient qualification for enrolment on any State Register of Indian Medicine . Thus the same principles as had been laid down in 20
