23 . Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record of the case , we find no merit in the appeals . In our view , the reasoning and the conclusion arrived at by the High Court appears to be legal and proper . 24 . The short question , which arises for consideration in these appeals is , if the Collector declines to award interest on the compensation under Section 28A proceedings to the landowners , which is the legal remedy available to the landowners against such order-the landowners should approach the Civil Court in reference under Section 28A ( 3 ) read with Section 18 of the Act or should file writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution . 25 . In order to decide the question arising in these appeals , some relevant sections need mention . These Sections are Sections 11 , 18 , 23 , 26 , 28 , 28-A and 34 of the Act which are mentioned verbatim infra . 11
