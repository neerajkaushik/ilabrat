8 for the appellants . It is submitted that Section 3 of 1976 Act provides that “ the State Government may by notification , constitute for the purpose of this Act , an authority to be called ( Name of the area ) Industrial Development Authority , for any Industrial Development Area ” . It is submitted that Authority is established under the 1976 Act . Referring to provisions of State Bank of India Act , 1955 , Life Insurance Corporation of India Act , 1956 , it is submitted that statute provides for establishing of the corporation by virtue of a notification by the Central Government . It is submitted that in similar manners Authority has been established by issuing a notification , hence , Authority has to be treated as established by the 1976 Act . Alternatively , it is submitted that the legislature has used the words “ by and under ” interchangeably which is clear from the provisions of Section 194A ( 3 ) ( iii ) ( c ) and Section 194A ( ( 3 ) ( iii ) ( d ) . In the Section 194A ( 3 ) ( iii ) , itself differentiation in “ by and under ” has been done away , with that the Authority established by 1976 Act is clearly covered by the Notification dated 22.10.1970 . The Notification dated 17.04.1976 establishing Authority fulfills the mandate of “ by ” hence it is clearly entitled for the benefit of the Section 194A ( 3 ) ( iii ) .
