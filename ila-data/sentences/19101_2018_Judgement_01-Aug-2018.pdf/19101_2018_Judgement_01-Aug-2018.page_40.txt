unfounded altogether . However , since we have not agreed with the conclusion of the AFT that the appointment to the post of DGMS ( Army ) is not based on seniority alone , it may not be proper to uphold such a direction of the AFT . While setting aside this direction , we remit the case back to the Raksha Mantri . We repose full faith in the Raksha Mantri and are confident that she would consider the entire matter in a totally dispassionate manner , with utmost objectivity and depicting total fairness . Copy of this judgment and particularly the findings recorded by us , including the admitted facts which are culled out hereinbefore , would also be placed before the Raksha Mantri . Keeping in view that the post is lying vacant for some time and also that time is running out insofar as the respondent is concerned , we direct the appellants to place the matter before the Raksha Mantri forthwith , with no loss of time , and are hopeful that the decision shall be taken within a week . 51 ) The civil appeal is partly allowed and is disposed of in the aforesaid terms . nase pneneseneene nme sensenenseneennsesnnees J.
