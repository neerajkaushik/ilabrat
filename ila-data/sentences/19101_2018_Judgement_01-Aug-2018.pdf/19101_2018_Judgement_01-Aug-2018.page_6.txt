i ) 8 ) to be on the same standards which were adopted in original SPB meeting . ” A clear message in the aforesaid order of the AFT as well as order of this Court was that the respondent is to be assigned 1.70 marks insofar as ‘ overall profile ’ was concerned , which was the standard adopted by the SPB ( Medical ) itself on an earlier occasion . On the award of 1.70 marks under the aforesaid head , the overall tally of marks of respondent would have been more than Major General Sanjiv Chopra who was junior to the respondent and was promoted as Lt. General . As a natural corollary , the respondent would have also been entitled to promotion in the said rank of Lt. General . However , notwithstanding this simple logic , the respondent had to struggle hard even thereafter to get his legitimate due . In the fresh Review by SPB ( Medical ) held on 4 " December , 2017 , the respondent was again given 1.5 marks by the SPB ( Medical ) . When the respondent came to learn about the same , he immediately rushed to the AFT by means of M.A. No. 1518 of 2017 in O.A. No. 1093 of 2017 . This application was filed on 6 " December , 2017 seeking restraint against the appellants from filling up the post of DGMS ( Army ) . In this application , the AFT passed orders dated 7 " December , 2017 directing the appellant Civil Appeal No. 5800 of 2018 Page 6 of 40
