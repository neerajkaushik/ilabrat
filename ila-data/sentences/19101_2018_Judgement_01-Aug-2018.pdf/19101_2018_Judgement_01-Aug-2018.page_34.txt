view of the AFT that the post of DGMS ( Army ) is to be filled by the officer on the strength of ‘ seniority-cum-suitability ’ , where seniority is a decisive factor and suitability is a secondary factor , is not correct . In the entire discussion resting with the aforesaid view , the Tribunal ignored the fact that it is not only seniority and suitability simpliciter but ‘ inter se ’ seniority and suitability . The expression ‘ inter se ’ is totally ignored and there is no discussion thereupon at all , which has led the AFT to take wrong view insofar as interpretation of the criteria laid down in the Circular dated 10 " July , 1992 is concerned , which talks of ‘ inter se seniority and suitability ’ . 46 ) Having made this legal position clear , we advert to the facts of the present case . 47 ) Some admitted facts which are pertinent for the outcome of the present appeal need to be highlighted at this juncture .
