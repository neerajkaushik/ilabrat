and his pension woes are being decided after 27 years and unfortunately not in his favour . 3 . We recommend to the Department of Personnel and Training of the Government of India to try and make life after retirement easier for a government servant by having appropriate legislation enacted by Parliament or applicable Pension Rules rather than a khichdi of Instructions , Office Memoranda , Clarifications , Corrigenda and so on and so forth . 4 . When the respondent retired as a Train Examiner with the Indian Railways , he was in the pay scale of Rs. 1400-2300 . After the 5 " Central Pay Commission was implemented , the replacement scale for the post of Train Examiner ( which was apparently abolished ) became Rs.4500-7000 . 5 . According to the respondent the post of Train Examiner was re-designated as Junior Engineer Grade-II and the revised pay of a Junior Engineer Grade-II was recommended by the 5 " Central Pay Commission to be Rs. 5000-8000 . The difference in the replacement scale of a Train Examiner as against the revised scale in the case of Junior Engineer Grade-II made a difference of about Rs. 500 per month in the pension entitlement of the respondent . 6 . On 30 " September , 1997 a Policy Resolution was notified by the Government of India relating to the scope and extent of the application of C.A. No . of 2018 ( Arising out of S.L.P.
