Office Memorandum dated 17 " December , 1998 clarifying the policy resolution of the Government of India dated 30 " September , 1997 . 14 . While dealing with this question , this Court held in paragraphs 17 and 27 of the Report as follows : C.A. No . Page 6 of 8 â€œ 17 . The main thrust of the submissions of learned counsel for the appellants is that the OM dated 11-5-2001 overrides the original OM dated 17-12-1998 and creates two classes of pensioners . We are unable to accept this contention . As noticed above , the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission were accepted to the extent of policy resolution dated 30-9-1997 . The aforesaid Policy Resolution was further clarified by issuing instructions in OM dated 17-12-1998 , which were clarified by another executive instructions in OM dated 11-5-2001 . It is well-settled principle of law that recommendations of the Pay Commission are subject to the acceptance/rejection with modifications of the appropriate Government . It is also well-settled principle of law that a policy decision of the Government can be reviewed/altered/modified by executive instructions . It is in these circumstances that a policy decision can not be challenged on the ground of estoppel . In the present case , the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission were accepted by a Policy Resolution dated 30-9-1997 that the ceiling on the amount of pension will be 50 % of the highest pay in the Government . The pension of all pre-1-1-1996 retirees including pre-1986 retirees shall be consolidated as on 1-1-1996 , but the consolidated pension shall not be brought on to the level of 50 % of the minimum of the revised pay of the post held by the pensioner at the time of retirement . The subsequent OM dated 17-12-1998 clarified the Policy Resolution dated 30-9-1997 by executive instructions in OM dated 17-12-1998 and further clarified in the form of OM dated 11-5-2001 clarifying the contents of Policy Resolution of the Government dated 30-9-1997 . They are both complementary to each other . Both clarify the government Policy Resolution dated 30-9-1997 . The appellants are not aggrieved by the executive instructions in OM dated 17-12-1998 . In our view , therefore , the contention of the appellant that the OM dated 11-5-2001 overrides the original OM dated 17-12-1998 , thereby creating two classes of pensioners is absolutely ill-founded and untenable . of 2018 ( Arising out of S.L.P.
