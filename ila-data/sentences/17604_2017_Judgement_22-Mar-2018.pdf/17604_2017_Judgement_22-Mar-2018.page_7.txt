27 . For the reasons aforestated , the view taken by the Madras High Court that the clarificatory executive instructions in OM dated 11-5-2001 are an integral part of the OM dated 17-12-1998 clarifying the policy resolution of the Government dated 30-9-1997 and do not override the original OM dated 17-12-1998 is correct law and it is , accordingly , affirmed . The view taken by the Delhi High Court that OM dated 11-5-2001 overrides the original OM dated 17-12-1998 and creates two classes of pensioners does not lay down the correct law and is , hereby , set aside . ‚Äù 15 . Unfortunately , the High Court has not even referred to this Judgment while taking a decision in favour of the respondent . Since the issue is squarely covered by the decision of this Court in Krishnaswamy , the appeal must be allowed . 16 . Yet another error made by the High Court is in assuming that the post of Train Examiner was re-designated as Junior Engineer Grade-II . There is nothing on record to suggest the re-designation . In fact the conclusion of re-designation is the sole basis on which the writ petition was allowed by the High Court and as mentioned above , we do not find any material on record to suggest the re-designation . Consequently , the entire basis of the decision of the High Court is erroneous , apart from the fact that the High Court did not advert to the decision of this Court in Krishnaswamy on the subject . 17 . In the circumstances , we have no option but to set aside the impugned judgment and order of the Madras High Court and we do so accordingly . The appeal is allowed . C.A.
