circumstances must be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his innocence . 10 . In a case , based on circumstantial evidence , the inference of guilt can be drawn only when all the incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with the innocence of the accused . In Trimukh Maroti Kirkan v. State of Maharashtra ( 2006 ) 10 SCC 681 , it was held as under : " 12 . we The normal principle in a case based on circumstantial evidence is that the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established ; that those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused ; that the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and they should be incapable of explanation on any hypothesis other than that of the guilt of the accused and inconsistent with their innocence . " The same principle was reiterated in State of Rajasthan v. Kashi Ram ( 2006 ) 12 SCC 254 , Ganesh Lal v. State of Rajasthan ( 2002 ) 1 SCC 731 , State of Maharashtra v. Suresh ( 2000 ) 1 SCC 471 and State of Tamil Nadu v. Rajendran ( 1999 ) 8 SCC 679 . Page No. 7 of 13
