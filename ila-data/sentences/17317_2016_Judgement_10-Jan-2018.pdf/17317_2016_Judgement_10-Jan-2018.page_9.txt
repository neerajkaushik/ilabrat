In this case the entire jewellery was stolen . Therefore , the averaging out clause will not apply and the claimant is entitled to a sum of Rs. 1,00,500 / under this head . ii ) Silver cutlery sets - The case of the claimant is that these were insured under the head of ‘ kitchenware/crockery / cutlery ’ items .
