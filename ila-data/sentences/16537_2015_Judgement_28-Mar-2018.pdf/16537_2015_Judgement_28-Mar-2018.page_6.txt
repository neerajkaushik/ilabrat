opinion that while the investigation was still incomplete , the High Court ought not to have interfered in the present case . Leaving all questions open to be agitated at appropriate stages in the proceeding , we set aside the view taken by the High Court and allow these appeals . Consequently Crime No. 304 of 2012 stands restored to its file and the appellant is free to conduct investigation and take the matter to its logical conclusion . bebe eeeeteee eee eaeeeeeees J.
