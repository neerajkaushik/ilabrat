training for examining the forest produce . The concerned forest officers have nowhere stated in their evidence that they were duly authorised by the State Government and competent to issue the certificates in question . Going by the material on record , it can be said that the prosecution has failed to prove that the requirements as contemplated under Section 62C of the Act were met by the concerned officers before issuing the impugned certificates . There is also no other admissible evidence on record in support of the prosecution case that the confiscated items were sandalwood billets . Under the circumstances , the High Court was right in setting aside the order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court by reaching to the conclusion that the offence under Section 87 of the Act can not be said to have been established against the accused in accordance with law . 10 . For all the aforesaid reasons , we find no merit in these appeals calling for our interference with the impugned orders passed by the High Court . The criminal appeals are accordingly dismissed .
