8 such circumstance there was every possibility of witnessing the occurrence of the incident in the house of the accused . Furthermore , all other aspects relating to the earlier sequence of events which had led to the incident having occurred in the house of Dilip is taken note and when the appellant as also the deceased were inside the house and in the circumstance the death on the spot had occurred , the death in the manner as contended by the prosecution and spoken to by PW-1 and PW-8 is to be accepted . Further the said witnesses PW-1 and PW-8 were also chased by the appellant from the very spot where the incident occurred . That apart , the ‘ katti ’ was recovered and the forensic report also supported the case of the prosecution . 9 . In that circumstance , having reappreciated the evidence to the extent it is required and a detailed perusal of the judgment passed by the Sessions Court as also the High Court would indicate that both the Courts have adverted to the evidence in detail and have ultimately arrived at the conclusion . In such circumstances , when the concurrent judgment based upon the evidence have found the appellant to be guilty of the charge alleged against him in committing the murder and had convicted him under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code , we see no other reason to take a different view .
