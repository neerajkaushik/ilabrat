16 . We , however , make it clear that we have refrained from making any observation on merits of the controversy having formed an opinion to remand the case to the High Court for the reasons mentioned above . The High Court would , therefore , decide the appeal , uninfluenced by any of our observations , strictly in accordance with law . Since the appeal is quite old , we request the High Court to ensure expeditious disposal of the appeal . 17 . The appeal is accordingly allowed . Impugned order is set aside with the aforesaid directions . ( R.K. AGRAWAL ) ee ee re J. ( ABHAY MANOHAR SAPRE ) New Delhi , February 15 , 2018
