It is really unfortunate that the Division Bench failed to keep in mind this principle while disposing of the appeal and passed a cryptic and unreasoned order . Such order undoubtedly caused prejudice to the parties because it deprived them to know the reasons as to why one party has won and other has lost .

In the light of the foregoing discussion , we allow the appeal , set aside the impugned order and remand the case to the Division Bench of the High Court for deciding the appeal afresh on merits in accordance with law keeping in view our observations made supra .
