It was further held that though there are provisions in the Tariff Regulations framed by the CERC covering the same field , the said Regulations , being in the nature of subordinate legislation , can not override the provisions of a law duly enacted ( Act of 1948 ) , particularly , in the absence of any legislative intention to the said effect in any of the provisions of the 2003 Act .

The tabular chart , extracted below , would indicate the five issues that have been finalized by the learned Appellate Tribunal by upholding the order of the CERC dated 3 â„¢ October , 2006 and the other five issues which have been remanded for re-determination by the CERC .
