38 Railway Clauses Consolidation Act , 1845 , was under consideration : “ It is true that Section 51 is framed as a proviso upon preceding sections . But it is also true that the latter half of it , though in form a proviso , is in substance a fresh enactment , adding to and not merely qualifying that which goes before . ” , and contends that the latter portion of the proviso , in question , being a substantive enactment , comprehends not only those suits which were pending on the date of repeal but also those cases , which came within the language of the latter part of the proviso , whenever the Act was extended to NeW areaS ......... . beveeeee As a general rule , a proviso is added to an __ enactment __ to qualify or create an exception to what is in the enactment , and ordinarily , a proviso is not interpreted as stating a general rule . But , provisos are often added not as exceptions or qualifications to the main enactment but as savings clauses , in which cases they will not be construed as controlled by the section . ” 40 . Similarly in S. Sundaram Pillai ( supra ) this Court has observed : “ A very apt description and extent of a proviso was given by Lord Oreburn in Rhondda Urban District Council v. Taff Vale Railway Co. , ( 1909 ) A.C. 253 , where it was pointed out that insertion of a proviso by the draftsman is not always strictly adhered to its legitimate use and at times a section worded as a proviso may wholly or partly be in substance a fresh enactment adding to and not merely excepting something out of or qualifying what goes before . ”
