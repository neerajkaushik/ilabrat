So far as the specific heads of tariff fixation are concerned , it has been urged on behalf of the CERC that Section 40 of the Act of 1948 has been wrongly relied upon by the learned Appellate Tribunal in determining the question of the extent of depreciation allowable . It is emphasised that Section 40 leaves the question of the percentage of depreciation to be determined by the Central Government . It is contended that the purpose and intent behind the enactment of 2003 Act is to distance the Central Government from the determination of tariff under the 2003 Act which is to be fixed by the Regulatory Commissions on the principles acknowledged in the Tariff Regulations . Regulation 21 ( 1 ) ( ii ) of the Tariff Regulations , therefore , according to the CERC , should have been the basis for the determination of the extent of depreciation . In this regard , reliance has been placed on the decision of this Court in PTC India Ltd. vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission ? . 5 ( 2010 ) 4 SCC 603 [ Para 17 ]
