19 provisions of the 2003 Act which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act , 1986 or the Atomic Energy Act , 1962 or the Railways Act , 1989 that will not have any effect . Instead , insofar as the Corporation is concerned what was provided for is a limited exemption , the extent of which has been spelt out by Section 14 ( fourth proviso ) of the 2003 Act , which , necessarily , has to be understood to be circumscribed by the provisions of the main part of Section 14 of the 2003 Act which deals with licensing as distinguished from tariff determination . It is further urged on behalf of the appellants â€” consumers that the decision to keep in abeyance the tariff for a period of two years is ultra vires the provisions of the 2003 Act , there being no authority in law to order any such relaxation or to postpone the coming into effect of the tariff fixed under the 2003 Act . The fact that the provisions of the Act of 1948 do not find any mention in the proviso to Section 61 of the 2003 Act has also been stressed upon .
