mn a purpose of the factory . The word ‘ including ’ would clearly indicate that the lands held by way of lease are also part of a scheduled undertaking . In any case the words “ including any leasehold interest therein ” can not be understood to have a limiting effect and result in the acquisition of only the leasehold interest in the land . . If the intention of the Legislature was to exclude leasehold lands it could have expressed the same by adding lands held on lease along with agricultural and grove lands . As per Section 2 ( h ) ( vi ) all lands other than lands held or occupied for purpose of cultivation and grove lands are part of scheduled undertaking . In view of above , we are of the opinion that the land in dispute stood vested in the State Government on the appointed day i.e. 03.07.1971 . . The findings recorded above would have been sufficient to dispose of the controversy in this case . But it has become necessary for us to deal with the findings of the High Court that the Plaintiffs are not entitled for any compensation for their lands . The reason given by the High Court is that the lease executed by the Plaintiffs was contrary to Section 156 of the 1950 Act . And , the consequence of the violation of Section 156 is that the transaction is void and the Plaintiffs lost all rights in the property as per Section 167 of the Act .
