All that had been stated in the application was that the objections which were raised by the office were not removed , as no noting was found in the official record to indicate that the same were duly removed before the expiry of the limitation period . The ground urged by the appellant did not commend to the High Court . For , the High Court found that the same was based on mere conjectures and surmises . The High Court instead found that as per Rule 284 , the matter was required to be listed before the High Court only if the objections were not removed within the time fixed therefor or as per the order , if any , passed by the Court under Rule 283 . On the other hand , the subject petition was placed before the Court under Rule 285 which presupposes that it was so done only after the office objections were duly cured . It noted that if the matter was placed before the Court under Rule 285 by the Office , it had to be presumed that the Office had done so after due scrutiny of the petition and on being satisfied that office objections had been duly removed . Further , it was only an administrative function of the High Court and could not be the basis to dismiss the election
