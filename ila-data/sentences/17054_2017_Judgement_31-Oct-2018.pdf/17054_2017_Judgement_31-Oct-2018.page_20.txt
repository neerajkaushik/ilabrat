20 communicated by letter dated 16.10.1975 . The Trust on 09.06.1982 , thus , has alloted only 24 acres out of 44.61 acres of land . The facts of the case and correspondence as noticed above clearly indicate that at no point of time allotment of 44.61 acres was made in favour of the plaintiff . The decision to allot 44.61 acres was communicated on 16.10.1975 on terms and conditions mentioned therein . The plaintiff having expressed certain reservation with the conditions and asked for relaxation of conditions and the Trust after taking into consideration the entire facts and circumstances took a decision to allot only 24 acres of land out of 44.61 acres on 09.06.1982 , there was never any firm allotment of 44.61 acres of land to the plaintiff giving any indefeasible right of allotment of 44.61 acres of land and the plaintiff herself has to be blamed for not getting allotment of entire 44.61 acres of land on account of she having raised request for the reduction of the premium and she having not communicated her consent to accede to the terms and conditions of allotment as proposed by the Trust .
