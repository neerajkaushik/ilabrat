10 . The provisions of Section 115 of the Code have been examined by judicial decisions on several occasions . While exercising its jurisdiction Under Section 115 , it is not competent to the High Court to correct errors of fact however gross they may , or even errors of law , unless the said errors have relation to the jurisdiction of the court to try the dispute itself . As Clauses ( a ) , ( b ) and ( e ) of Section 115 indicate , it is only in cases where the subordinate court has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law , or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested , or has acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity that the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court can be properly invoked . It is conceivable that points of law may arise in proceedings instituted before subordinate courts which are related to questions of jurisdiction . It is well settled that a plea of limitation or a plea of res judicata is a plea of law which concerns the jurisdiction of the court which tries the proceedings . A finding on these pleas in favour of the party raising them would oust ’ the jurisdiction of the court , and so , an erroneous decision on these pleas can be said to be concerned with questions of jurisdiction which fall within the purview of Section 115 of the Code . But an erroneous decision on a question of law reached by the subordinate court which has no relation to questions of jurisdiction of that court , can not be corrected by the High Court Under Section 115 . ” 36
