29 35 . In Anuj Garg and Others v. Hotel Association of India and others ’ , a two-Judge Bench , while dealing with the constitutional validity of Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act , 1914 prohibiting employment of “ any man under the age of 25 years ” or “ any woman ” in any part of such premises in which liquor or intoxicating drug is consumed by the public , opined thus in the context of the parens patriae power of the State : “ 29 . One important justification to Section 30 of the Act is parens patriae power of State . It is a considered fact that use of parens patriae power is not entirely beyond the pale of judicial scrutiny . 30 . Parens patriae power has only been able to gain definitive legalist orientation as it shifted its underpinning from being merely moralist to a more objective grounding i.e. utility . The subject-matter of the parens patriae power can be adjudged on two counts : ( j in terms of its necessity , and ( ii ) assessment of any trade-off or adverse impact , if any . This inquiry gives the doctrine an objective orientation and therefore prevents it from falling foul of due process challenge . ( See City of Cleburne v.
