38 Court dismissed the applications on facts for want of evidence , yet it made certain observations regarding extremism and radicalization . 51 . Mr. Divan has drawn our attention to the authority in A Local Authority v. Y ‚Äù ? wherein the High Court ( Family Division ) invoked its inherent jurisdiction to protect a young person , the defendant Y , from radicalization . 52 . Relying upon the aforesaid decisions , he emphasized on the concept that when the major is a vulnerable adult , the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India can exercise the parens patriae doctrine which has been exercised in this case . The aforesaid judgments , in our considered opinion , are not applicable to the facts of the present case . We say so without any hesitation as we have interacted with the respondent No. 9 and there is nothing to suggest that she suffers from any kind of mental incapacity or vulnerability . She was absolutely categorical in her submissions and unequivocal in the expression of her choice . 23 [ 2017 ] EWHC 968 ( Fam )
