53 Court can not get into the aspect whether she has been forced by the father or not . There may be ample reasons on her behalf to go back to her father in Kuwait , but we are not concerned with her reasons . What she has stated before the Court , that alone matters and that is the heart of the reasoning for this Court , which keeps all controversies at bay . 10 . It needs no special emphasis to state that attaining the age of majority in an individual 's life has its own significance . She/He is entitled to make her/his choice . The courts can not , as long as the choice remains , assume the role of parens patriae . The daughter is entitled to enjoy her freedom as the law permits and the court should not assume the role of a super guardian being moved by any kind of sentiment of the mother or the egotism of the father . We say so without any reservation . ” These principles emerge from a succession of judicial decisions . Fundamental to them is the judgment of a Constitution bench of this Court in Kanu Sanyal v District Magistrate , Darjeeling ® . 15 The High Court was seized of the grievance of Asokan that his daughter was under illegal confinement and was likely to be transported out of the country . In the course of the hearing of an earlier petition for habeas corpus , the High Court by its order dated 19 January 2016 expressly noticed that Hadiya was not willing to return to her parental home . Taking note of the desire of Hadiya to reside at Sathyasarani , the High Court observed that “ the alleged detenue needs to be given liberty to take her own decision with respect to her future life . ” 36 ( 1973 ) 2 SCC 674
