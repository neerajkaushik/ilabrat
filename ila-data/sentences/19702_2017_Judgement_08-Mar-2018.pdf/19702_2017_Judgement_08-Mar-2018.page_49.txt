49 Court as a constitutional court can not be disputed . Halsbury ’s Laws of England postulates : “ In the ordinary way the Supreme Court , as a superior court of record , exercise the full plenitude of judicial power in all matters concerning the general administration of justice within its territorial limits , and enjoys unrestricted and unlimited powers in _ all _ matters of substantive law , both civil and criminal , except insofar as that has been taken away in unequivocal terms by statutory enactment . The term “ inherent jurisdiction ” is not used in contradistinction to the jurisdiction of the court exercisable at common law or conferred on it by statute or rules of court , for the court may exercise its inherent_jurisdiction even _ in_respect_of matters _ which_are regulated by statute or rule of court . The jurisdiction of the court which is comprised within the term “ inherent ” is_that which enables it to fulfil itself , properly and effectively , as a court of law . ” Dealing with the ambit of the powers under Article 226 , Gajendragadkar , CJ in State of Orissa v Ram Chandra Dev and Mohan Prasad Singh Deo “ observed thus : “ Under Article 226 of the Constitution , the jurisdiction of the High Court is undoubtedly very wide . Appropriate writs can be issued by the High Court under the said Article even for purposes other than the enforcement of the fundamental rights and in that sense , a party who invokes the special jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 is not confined to case of illegal invasion of this fundamental right alone . But though the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226 is wide in that sense , the concluding words of that Article clearly indicate that before a writ or an appropriate order can be issued in favour of a party , it must be established that the party has a right and the said right is illegally invaded or threatened . The existence of a right is thus the foundation of a petition under Article 226 . ” While dealing with the powers and privileges of the state legislatures , in Keshav Singh ” , a Bench of seven learned judges held thus : 24 AIR ( 1964 ) SC 685 25 ( 1965 ) 1 SCR 413
