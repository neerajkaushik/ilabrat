18 â€œ After due deliberation , we thought it appropriate to interact with Akhila @ Hadiya and we have accordingly interacted with her in Court . We were told that though she can communicate in English , she may not be able to effectively articulate in that language . Hence , we requested Mr. V. Giri , learned senior counsel , who also represents the State of Kerala to assist in translating the questions posed to her in Court and the answers given by her . The range of questions that we posed basically pertained to her qualifications , interest in studies , perception of life and what she intends to do in future . In response to our queries , she responded by stating that she has passed Class X from Higher Secondary School in K.V. Puram , Vaikom in Kottayam District and thereafter she was prosecuting her BHMS course in _ Shivaraj Homeopathy Medical College in Salem in the State of Tamil Nadu . She has also stated that she intends to continue her internship / housemanship which she had left because of certain reasons and her ambition is to become a full-fledged homeopathic doctor . She has expressed her desire to stay in the hostel and complete the course in the said college , if a seat is made available . In the above view , we direct , as desired by her , that she be taken to Salem so as to enable her to pursue her internship/housemanship . We also direct the college to admit her and to allow the facility of a room or a shared room in the hostel as per practice to enable her to continue her internship/housemanship afresh . Be it stated , she herself has stated that the duration of the internship/housemanship is likely to be for 11 months . If any formality is to be complied with , the college shall communicate with the university and the university shall accede to the same . Our directions are to be followed in letter and spirit by all concerned . Needless to say , when she stays in the hostel , she will be treated like any other student
