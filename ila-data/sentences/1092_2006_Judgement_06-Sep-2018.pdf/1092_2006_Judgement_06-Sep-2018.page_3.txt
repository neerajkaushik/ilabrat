3 impugned order . We have also perused the materials on record . ( 6 ) So far as acquittal of accused No ( s ) .4 and 5 are concerned , the High Court has ' held that even ’ though Annapoornama ( PW-3 ) has mentioned the names of all the accused in the complaint , she has not attributed any overt act to accused No ( s ) .4 and 5 and the High Court observed that in the absence of any specific overt act attributed to accused no. 4 and 5 they can not be held guilty under Section 302 I.P.C. which in our considered view can not be said to be _ unreasonable warranting interference by this _ Court . Insofar as _ the modification of the conviction from Section 302 I.P.C. to Section 304 Part-II I.P.C. and the reduction of the sentence of imprisonment in respect of other accused are concerned , the High Court has recorded its reasoning in para ‘ 15 ’ of the order . The High Court has observed that accused No. 1 alone had previous enmity with the deceased-Siddaramreddy and the other accused appeared to have joined accused no. 1 only to help him . Considering the weapons used , namely , sticks and the nature of the injuries , the High Court thought it fit to modify the sentence of imprisonment under Section 302 I.P.C. to Section 304 Part-II I.P.C. Occurrence was of the year 1995 and at this distant point of time and also in view of the findings by the High Court in para “ 55 ” , we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order .
