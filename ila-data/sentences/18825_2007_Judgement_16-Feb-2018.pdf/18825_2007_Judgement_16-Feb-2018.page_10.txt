would show that such " order " must be in the nature of a " notification " , " rules " and " bye laws " etc. ( see â€” Indian National Congress ( I ) vs. Institute of Social Welfare & Ors. , 2002 ( 5 ) SCC 685 ) . 24 . In other words , the order , which can be modified or rescinded by applying Section 21 , has to be either executive or legislative in nature whereas the order , which the CIT is required to pass under Section 12A of the Act , is neither legislative nor an executive order but it is a " quasi judicial order " . It is for this reason , Section 21 has no application in this case . 25 . The general power , under Section 21 of the General Clauses Act , to rescind a notification or order has to be understood in the light of the subject matter , context and the effect of the relevant provisions of the statute under which the notification or order is issued and the power is not available after an enforceable right has accrued 10
