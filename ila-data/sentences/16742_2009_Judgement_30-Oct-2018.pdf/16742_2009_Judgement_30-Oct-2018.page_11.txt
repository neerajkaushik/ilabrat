evidence of the prosecutrix , we find no inconsistency between MLC ( Ex.-PW6 / A ) and the statement of SI Jai Bhagwan ( PW-7 ) . 17 . Drawing our attention to the evidence of prosecutrix who submitted that the prosecutrix regained consciousness only at 10.00 AM on 29.07.1997 and while so SI Jai Bhagwan could not have recorded her statement at around 02.30 AM on 29.07.1997 as stated by him and this again throws serious doubt about the prosecution case . The prosecutrix ( PW-1 ) was examined in the court on 05.11.1999 nearly two years after the occurrence and she might not have been able to recollect the happenings as it is . It is also pertinent to note that SI Jai Bhagwan ( PW-7 ) has enquired the Doctor and the Doctor has declared that prosecutrix was fit to make the statement and only thereafter the statement of prosecutrix ( PW1 ) was recorded ( Ex.-PW1 / A ) . In the light of the evidence of SI Jai Bhagwan that the Doctor declared the prosecutrix fit to make the statement , there is no merit in the contention of the accused raising doubts about the recording of statement of the prosecutrix at 02.30 AM on 29.07.1997 . 18 . On the next day ie , on 29-07-1997 all the accused/respondents were arrested by SI Jai Bhagwan ( PW-7 ) and they were medically examined in the hospital between 11.36 AM to 11
