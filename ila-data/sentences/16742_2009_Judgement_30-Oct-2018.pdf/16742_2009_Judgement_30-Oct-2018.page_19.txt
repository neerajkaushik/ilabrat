No. 559/97 under Section 376 IPC read with Section 34 IPC was registered at 03.15 AM on 29.07.1997 . 29 . After referring to the timings of FIR No. 558/97 , the High Court held that the quarrelling ladies including the prosecutrix were in custody of the police at least till 08.50 PM and it was highly improbable that the prosecutrix could have come back and was alone in her jhuggi at 09.00 PM on 28.07.1997 and that the respondents/accused entered her jhuggi and committed rape as alleged by her and that even before 09.30 PM , she was picked up from there by PCR Van . The High Court therefore concluded that SI Jai Bhagwan , constable Khushi Ram ( PW-4 ) and the prosecutrix ( PW-1 ) have fabricated false case against the accused . In this regard , the High Court relied upon the Report of Joint Commissioner dated 07.11.2000 ( Ex.-DW6 / A ) and the Report of S.K. Gautam , DCP . 30 . The reasoning of the High Court that the ladies were arrested in connection with FIR No. 558/97 under Section 160 IPC and that the ladies must have remained with the custody of police till 09.20 PM proceeds on presumptive footing and surmises . In his evidence , Mahanand Jha ( DW-1 ) has stated that “ the said ladies came back to the area at 08.30 PM and started abusing the neighbourers ” . 19
