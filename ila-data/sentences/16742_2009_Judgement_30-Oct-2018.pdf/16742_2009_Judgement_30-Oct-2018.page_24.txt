Srinivasan and Another ( 1975 ) 2 SCC 466 and Niranjan Patnaik v. Sashibhusan Kar and Another ( 1986 ) 2 SCC 569 ( to which one of us was a party ) . Judged in the light of the above tests , it may be seen that none of the tests is satisfied in this case . It is indeed regrettable that the High Court should have lightly passed adverse remarks of a_very serious nature affecting the character and professional competence and integrity of the appellant in purported desire to render justice to Respondents 2 and 3 in the petition filed by them for expunction of adverse remarks made against them . ” [ Underlining added ] . In Manish Dixit and Others v. State of Rajasthan ( 2001 ) 1 SCC 596 , this Court held as under : “ A2 . ......... Such disparaging remarks and the direction to initiate departmental action against him could have a very serious impact on his official career . 43 . Even those apart , this Court has repeatedly cautioned that before any castigating remarks are made by the court against any person , particularly when such remarks could ensure serious consequences on the future career of the person concerned , he should have been given an opportunity of being heard in the matter in_respect_of the proposed remarks or strictures . Such an opportunity is the basic requirement , for , otherwise the offending remarks would be in violation of the principles of natural justice . In this case such an opportunity was not given to PW 30 ( Devendra Kumar Sharma ) . ( State of U.P. v. Mohd . Naim AIR 1964 SC 703 , Ch . Jage Ram , Inspector of Police and Another v. Hans Raj Midha ( 1972 ) 1 SCC 181 , R.K. Lakshmanan v. A.K. Srinivasan and Another ( 1975 ) 2 SCC 466 , Niranjan Patnaik v. Sashibhusan Kar and Another ( 1986 ) 2 SCC 569 and State of Karnataka v. Registrar General , High Court of Karnataka ( 2000 ) 7 SCC 333 ) . ” [ Underlining added ] Since the High Court has passed strictures against the police officials who were involved in the investigation in FIR No. 559/1997 without affording an opportunity of hearing to them , the disparaging remarks are liable to be set aside . 24
