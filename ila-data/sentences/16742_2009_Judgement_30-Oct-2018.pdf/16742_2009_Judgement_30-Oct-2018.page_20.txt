Likewise , Sharabuddin ( DW-2 ) has stated that â€œ the police released the said ladies including Phoola ( PW-1 ) and after coming back to her jhuggi , she started abusing the neighbours . Then , | informed PCR Van on telephone and PCR Van came and took Phoola ........ " The High Court failed to appreciate the testimonies of DWs 1 and 2 who have categorically stated that the prosecutrix had come back and was abusing neighbours . The evidence of DWs 1 and 2 clearly shows that the prosecutrix was let out by the police at or about 08.20 PM on 28.07.1997 . Mere fact that FIR No. 558/97 under Section 160 IPC was registered at 09.20 PM does not indicate that the prosecutrix and other quarrelling ladies were in the police custody till 09.30 PM on 28.07.1997 ( with respect to the offence in FIR No. 558/97 ) . 31 . There were two sets of persons and two sets of officers are involved in FIR No. 558/97 and FIR No. 559/97 . The aspect regarding FIR No. 558/97 was not put to the witnesses even before the trial court . Everything was brought about in appeal as additional evidence in exercise of the power of the appellate court under Section 391 Cr . P.C. Placing of heavy reliance by the High Court upon the contents in FIR No. 558/97 was not a correct approach . 20
