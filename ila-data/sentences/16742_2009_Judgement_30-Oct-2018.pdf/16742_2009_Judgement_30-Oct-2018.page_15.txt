Even in cases where there is some material to show that the victim was habituated to sexual intercourse , no inference like the victim being a woman of ‘ loose moral character ” is permissible to be drawn from that circumstance alone . A woman of easy virtue also could not be raped by a person for that reason . In State of Punjab v. Gurmeet Singh and Others ( 1996 ) 2 SCC 384 , it was held as under : “ 16 . ...... Even if the prosecutrix , in a given case , has been promiscuous in her sexual behaviour earlier , she has a_right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and_everyone ......

It is now well-settled principle of law that conviction can be sustained on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix if it inspires confidence . [ Vishnu alias Undrya v. State of Maharashtra ( 2006 ) 15
