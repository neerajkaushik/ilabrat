However , prior to amendment , proviso to Section 376 ( 2 ) IPC provided a discretion to the court that “ the court may , for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment , impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than ten years . ” Though the court is vested with the discretion , in the facts and circumstances of the case , we are not inclined to exercise our discretion in reducing the sentence of imprisonment of ten years imposed upon the respondents-accused . 45 .
