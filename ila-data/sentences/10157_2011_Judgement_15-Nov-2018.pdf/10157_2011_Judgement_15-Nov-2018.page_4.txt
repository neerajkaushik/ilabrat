Hence , it could not have been allotted . A second application for ryotwari patta moved by Pachiappan was rejected as per government Order dated 11.5.1971 . Review application was filed by Pachiappan . It was also rejected vide order dated 7.5.1973 on the ground that records of rights made it apparent that disputed land formed part of ‘ Achuvaneri ' which is IV class irrigation source with wet ayacut registered under it and that it is retained as the tank in the interest of ayacutdars under it . It was also observed that the entire area comes into submergence and the land in question forms part of the irrigation tank . Unfettered by the previous two rejections , Pachiappan again for the third time applied for issuance of patta on 21.6.1982 . That application was ultimately rejected vide Ex . P-5 on 9.5.1984 .
