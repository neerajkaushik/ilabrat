In that context , this Court had held thus : “ 12 ... There can be transfer of title by payment of consideration and delivery of the car .

Noticing that the decision in Dr T V Jose was rendered under the Motor Vehicles Act , 1939 , the Court in Pushpa held that the ratio of the decision “ shall apply with equal force to the facts of the cases arising under the 1988 Act ” in view of the provisions of Section 2 ( 30 ) and Section 50 . Consequently , the view of this Court was that the person whose name continues in the record of the registering authority as the owner of the vehicle is equally liable together with the insurer . 9 The decision of a three judge Bench of this court in Purnya Kala Devi ( supra ) involved a situation where the registered owner of a vehicle involved in an accident denied his liability to compensate the legal heirs of the deceased victim on the ground that the state government had requisitioned the vehicle . On the date of the accident , the vehicle stood requisitioned under the Assam Requisition and Control of Vehicles Act , 1968 . The state failed to establish that the vehicle was released from requisition after service of a 4 ( 2001 ) 8 SCC 748 5 ( 2008 ) 17 SCC 624
