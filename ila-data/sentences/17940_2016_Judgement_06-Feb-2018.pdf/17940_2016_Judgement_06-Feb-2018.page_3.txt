2016 on the ground that there was no justification for the Tribunal to pass an award against the registered owner when there was evidence that he had transferred the vehicle and the last admitted owner was the appellant herein . In the view of the High Court , the Tribunal ought to have passed an award only against the appellant as the owner . In coming to this conclusion the High Court relied upon two decisions of this Court : HDFC Bank Limited v Reshma ’ and Purnya Kala Devi v State of Assam ’ . On behalf of the appellant , it has been submitted that the High Court has proceeded on a manifestly erroneous construction of the legal position . It has been urged that Section 2 ( 30 ) of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988 indicates that the person in whose name a motor vehicle is registered is the owner and the only two exceptions to that principle are where such a person is a minor or where the subject vehicle is under a hire purchase agreement . The decision of this Court in Purnya Kala Devi ( supra ) , it has been submitted , related to a situation where the offending vehicle had been requisitioned by a state government . Similarly , the decision in Reshma ( supra ) dealt with a situation where the vehicle had been financed against a hypothecation agreement . It was in this background that this Court held that the person in possession of the vehicle under a hypothecation agreement was to be treated as the owner .
