3 ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) regard to the definition contained in Section 2 ( 30 ) , it was urged that the High Court was in error in foisting the liability on the appellant who is not the registered owner of the vehicle . Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that in Pushpa alias Leela v Shakuntala ’ , the position has been clarified by holding that where notwithstanding the sale of a vehicle , neither the transferor nor the transferee have taken any step for change in the name of owner in the certificate of registration , the person in whose name the registration stands must be deemed to continue as the owner of the vehicle for the purposes of the Act . On the other hand , learned counsel appearing on behalf of the First respondent supported the judgment of the Tribunal by submitting that the appellant as the person in physical possession and control of the vehicle was liable . Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the First respondent also relied on the decisions of this Court in Purnya Kala Devi and Reshma . Learned counsel submits : “ The sale of a vehicle also results in a presumable change of physical possession and control of the vehicle from the vendor to the vehicle . The registered owner at the best can be regarded as an ostensible owner of the vehicle but not the real owner after the sale of the vehicle , even if his name is there on the Registration Certificate of the vehicle ; The definition of owner in the Section 2 ( 30 ) of the Act , is not a complete code and the exceptions contained therein are not exhaustive ; The Court/Tribunal should apply the test whether the registered owner has , through legitimate means , fully relinquished his possession and control over the vehicle or not . If the answer is in the ( 2011 ) 2 SCC 240
