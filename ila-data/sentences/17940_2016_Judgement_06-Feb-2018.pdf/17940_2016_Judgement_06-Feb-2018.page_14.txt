14 13 . The submission of the Petitioner is that a failure to intimate the transfer will only result in a fine under Section 50 ( 3 ) but will not invalidate the transfer of the vehicle . In Dr T V Jose , this Court observed that there can be transfer of title by payment of consideration and delivery of the car . But for the purposes of the Act , the person whose name is reflected in the records of the registering authority is the owner . The owner within the meaning of Section 2 ( 30 ) is liable to compensate . The mandate of the law must be fulfilled . 14 . For the above reasons we allow the appeal and direct that the liability to compensate the claimants in terms of the judgment of the Tribunal will stand fastened upon the First respondent . The judgment of the High Court is set aside . In the circumstances of the case , there shall be no order as to costs . sesessseessseessunesssueessueessueessueessees CJI [ DIPAK MISRA ] secessuessssesssessssuesssueessneesseessues J [ A M KHANWILKAR ] veessueessusessstessseesssueessueessaeessasess J [ Dr D Y CHANDRACHUD ] New Delhi ; February 06 , 2018
