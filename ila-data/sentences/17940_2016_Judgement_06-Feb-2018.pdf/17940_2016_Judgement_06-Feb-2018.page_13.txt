13 for the purposes of the Act , would be treated as the ‘ owner ’ . However , where a person is a minor , the guardian of the minor would be treated as the owner . Where a motor vehicle is subject to an agreement of hire purchase , lease or hypothecation , the person in possession of the vehicle under that agreement is treated as the owner . In a situation such as the present where the registered owner has purported to transfer the vehicle but continues to be reflected in the records of the registering authority as the owner of the vehicle , he would not stand absolved of liability . Parliament has consciously introduced the definition of the expression ‘ owner ’ in Section 2 ( 30 ) , making a departure from the provisions of Section 2 ( 19 ) in the earlier Act of 1939 . The principle underlying the provisions of Section 2 ( 30 ) is that the victim of a motor accident or , in the case of a death , the legal heirs of the deceased victim should not be left in a state of uncertainty . A claimant for compensation ought not to be burdened with following a trail of successive transfers , which are not registered with the registering authority . To hold otherwise would be to defeat the salutary object and purpose of the Act . Hence , the interpretation to be placed must facilitate the fulfilment of the object of the law . In the present case , the First respondent was the ‘ owner ’ of the vehicle involved in the accident within the meaning of Section 2 ( 30 ) . The liability to pay compensation stands fastened upon him . Admittedly , the vehicle was uninsured . The High Court has proceeded upon a misconstruction of the judgments of this Court in Reshma and Purnya Kala Devi .
