fulfil the requirements of law or not will have to be determined in each case â€™ . 8 In the present case it is necessary to note , as observed by the Tribunal , that the owner did not depose in evidence and stayed away from the witness box . He produced a licence which was found to be fake . Another licence which he sought to produce had already expired before the accident and was not renewed within the prescribed period . It was renewed well after two years had expired . The appellant as owner had evidently failed to take reasonable care ( proposition ( vii ) of Swaran Singh ) since he could not have been unmindful of facts which were within his knowledge . 9 In the circumstances , the direction by the Tribunal , confirmed by the High Court , to pay and recover can not be faulted . The appeal is , accordingly , dismissed . There shall be no order as to costs . ne on ] [ DIPAK MISRA ] vavracnavevemesnsesesoecnrsvveressenesie J [ A M KHANWILKAB ] nnn J [ Dr D Y CHANDRACHUD ] New Delhi ; March 06 , 2018
