wages to the workman which , in our opinion , has certainly caused prejudice to the appellant ( employer ) . 18 . However , having regard to all facts and circumstances of the case such as period and money spent in litigation by the deceased workman and on his death by his legal representatives coupled with the fact that the workman - â€” Phool Chand has since expired , we consider it just and proper and in the interest of justice to award to the respondents ( legal representatives of Late Phool Chand ) 50 % of the total back wages . 19 . This we award to the respondents in exercise of our powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India for doing substantial justice to the parties concerned having reiterated the legal principles which govern the question of award of back wages .
