JUDGMENT ARUN MISHRA , J. 1 . Leave granted . 2 . The question involved is whether after the abolition of Jagirs by virtue of the Himachal Pradesh Abolition of Big Landed Estates and Land Reforms Act , 1953 ( hereinafter referred to as ‘ the Abolition Act ’ ) , the late Jagirdar or his legal representatives could have claimed the compensation on the land acquisition being made particularly when land has vested in the State of Himachal Pradesh , the land was not under the personal cultivation , and particularly when they have received the compensation under the Abolition Act , apart from that had also received the compensation under the provisions of H.P. Ceiling on Land Holdings Act , 1972 ( hereinafter referred to as “ the Ceiling Act ” ) . 3 . The facts project how a litigant has filed a slew of litigations one after the other and faced with a situation that it was likely to be dismissed , he would withdraw it ; again , file it on new grounds , or having lost it , would withdraw it again at appellate stage , and in the meantime , in different proceedings by playing fraud , getting unjust enrichment by receiving compensation at the expense of public exchequer .
