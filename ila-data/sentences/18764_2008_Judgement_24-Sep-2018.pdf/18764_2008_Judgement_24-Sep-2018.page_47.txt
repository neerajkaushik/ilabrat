47 land . Fraud vitiates the solemn proceedings ; such plea can be set up even in collateral proceedings . The label on the petition is not much material and this Court has already permitted the plea of fraud to be raised . Moreover , Appeal arising out of 72 awards is still pending in the High Court in which Reference Court has declined compensation on the aforesaid ground . 64 . Reliance has also been placed on the observations made in Meher Rusi Dalal v. Union of India , ( 2004 ) 7 SCC 362 , in which this Court has dealt with the issue of apportionment of compensation for which claim was raised by the Union of India , not in the capacity of the owner but as a protected tenant . The claim of tenancy was not put forth before the LAO , though represented in the acquisition proceedings . This Court observed that in such a case it could reasonably be inferred that no right was being claimed and it ought to have been made before the LAO if it had any such claim in respect of pre-existing right . The LAO was not under a duty to make an enquiry . The claim of tenancy at the belated stage was an afterthought to frustrate the payment . The decision has no application to the instant case as the LAO in the awards passed , noted the factum of ceiling proceedings as such the effects of the same can always be considered .
