39 55 . Civil Suit No. 15/1970 was dismissed on merits . Thereafter in the first appeal , it was withdrawn by Rajinder Singh before the Division Bench on 23.6.1986 . Order dated 23.6.1986 passed by the High Court of withdrawal of C.S. No. 15 of 1970 in first appeal No. 9/1973 is extracted hereunder : â€œ In the present appeal , the learned counsel for the appellant has given the statement that by an order dated 10.06.1980 passed by the Collector Rampur Bushahar in case State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Rajkumar Rajender Singh , under section 8 of Himachal Pradesh Land Ceiling Act , the disputed land has been acquired by the Respondent and the Appellant has been paid compensation for the same . He has further stated that in the view of this subsequent event he may be permitted to withdraw the suit and the appeal may be dismissed as having become infructuous . It is not disputed that the land in dispute in this appeal is also the subject matter of dispute in the order dated 10.06.1980 passed by the Collector Rampur Bushahar . As the land in dispute has been acquired and the appellant has been paid the compensation for the same , therefore , we are of the view that due to the subsequent events there are sufficient grounds for allowing the plaintiff to institute a fresh suit for the subject matter and on the same cause of action . As a result , we allow the Plaintiff to withdraw the suit with permission to file a fresh suit in respect of the subject matter of the suit on the same cause of action in case there is any necessity to file such a subsequent suit . The suit is dismissed as withdrawn and the present appeal is dismissed as having become infructuous . The parties are left to bear their own costs of this appeal . "
