37 were entitled to only one unit of permissible area . The Financial Commissioner in the order dated 5.9.1985 has held against Rajinder Singh that his minor son Rajeshwar Singh could not have been allotted one unit vide order of competent authority dated 10.6.1980 , as such one unit more land has been allotted to the family than permissible under the ceiling law . It was also held that without enquiry transfers were held to be bona fide . Thus , the order passed by the SDO was set aside and the case was remanded to pass fresh order to declare the additional land as surplus than the one determined in the earlier order . The order of Competent Authority dated 10.6.1980 was not questioned by Late Rajinder Singh or his family members nor the order of Financial Commissioner passed on 5.9.1985 was questioned . It was not an order in favour of Rajinder Singh as contended on behalf of the respondents but was against his interest and remand order of 5.9.1985 directing additional land to be declared surplus also has attained finality . After remand , Collector ( Ceiling ) has declared additional land as surplus and total 19706 bighas 5 Biswas had been declared as surplus . As against the order passed by Collector ( Ceiling ) dated 10.11.1993 , the appeal was preferred to the Commissioner which was dismissed on 30.8.1996 . Revision filed against the said order was also dismissed on 18.1.2002 by the Financial Commissioner .
