Compensation and rehabilitation grant can be determined and paid later . This Court in the order dated 17.9.1969 made the following observations : â€œ It is apparent that S. 27 deals with lands the annual land revenue of which exceeds Rs. 125 per year . It says in unequivocal terms that the right . title and interest of the owner in such lands shall be deemed to have been transferred land vested in the State Government free from all encumbrances . This essentially means that on the enforcement of the Act the vesting takes place automatically and without being contingent on the happening of any other event .

In 8.11 the tenant had to exercise the option to acquire the right . title and interest of the landowner . The vesting of such rightswould necessary depends on the time of the exercise of such option . Similarly in 8.15 . a future date had to be provided in view of its special provisions . We do not consider that the provisions of sub S. 53 ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of S. 27 contain any indication that the vesting of rights of ownership in the Government would be dependent on the determination of compensation . The vesting takes place under sub-S . ( 1 ) immediately on the enforcement of the Act . Thereafter , under sub-S .

That can not prevent or have any bearing on the vesting which takes place under sub S ( 1 ) . The payment of rehabilitation grant which is provided by sub 8 ( 5 ) to a small landowner strengthens the reasoning in favour of vesting being automatic and immediate under sub S ( 1 ) . There can
