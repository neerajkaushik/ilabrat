a stipulation or the High Court may itself conduct a Hindi examination towards that objective by prescribing so . This is so as proficiency in the Hindi language is possibly a necessity arising out of the judicial work conducted in the State of Jharkhand . In any case , as noticed above , all the appellants have passed the examination and , thus , the only question of giving them the benefit of the increments and other mandatory benefits even for the period when they had not cleared the “ higher grade ” in the Hindi examination . 25 . Learned counsel for the appellants has also pointed out another ramification of the stand of the respondents , i.e. , that though the appellants joined in the year 2011 and , thus , came under the old pension scheme if what the respondents say is accepted then their subsequent confirmation would result in their not being covered under the old pension scheme but under the new contributory pension scheme , which came into force in terms of Notification dated 22.12.2013 . 26 . We , thus , also hold that the appellants would be entitled to be covered under the old pension scheme relatable to their entry into the service in the year 2011 . 13
