repealed the 2001 Rules . It was acknowledged in the impugned judgment that there was no reference of the 1963 Bihar Rules in the 2004 Rules nor is there a similar reference as in Rule 22 ( ii ) of the 2001 Rules . It was thus opined that the 1963 Bihar Rules , which were applicable to the 2001 Rules , can not be considered as inoperative or superseded or repealed by the 2004 Rules . The expression used ‘ alone ’ , in Rule 21 ( b ) of 2004 Rules was , thus , held not to imply that the Hindi examination could not be prescribed as a condition precedent for confirmation . The control by the High Court under Article 235 of the Constitution of India , it was held , empowered and allowed the High Court to prescribe the passing of Hindi examination and departmental examination for the members of the Subordinate Judiciary . Thus , the passing of the Hindi examination was held to be mandatory . It was also observed that this is so , even though it may cause hardship to the appellants , who would be disentitled to grant of increments till they pass the examination . 17 . It is in the aforesaid context that the High Court confirmed only such of the officers who had passed the Hindi Examination in the “ higher grade ” .
