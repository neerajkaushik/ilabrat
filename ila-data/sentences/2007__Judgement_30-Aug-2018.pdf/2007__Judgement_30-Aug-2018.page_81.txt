Neither the authorities of the other Union Territories have laid before the Court any relevant material in this regard . We , therefore , refrain from addressing the issue in question as far as other Union Territories are concerned and have confined our discussions and the consequential views only to the National Capital Territory of Delhi . 61 . Accordingly , we answer the question referred in terms of the views expressed in para 34 of this opinion . We further hold that so far as the National Capital Territory of Delhi is concerned the pan India Reservation Rule in force is in accord with the constitutional scheme relating to services under the Union and the States/Union Territories . 62 . In view of the conclusions reached as above , it will not be necessary to remit Civil Appeal Nos. 1085 of 2013 , 10081 of 2014 , 8141 of 2014 , 8802 of 2012 , 1086 of 2013 and Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition ( Civil ) 81
