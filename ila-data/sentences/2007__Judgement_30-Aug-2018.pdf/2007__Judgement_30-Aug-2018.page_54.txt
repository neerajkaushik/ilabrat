Examinations organised by the State-specific Public Service Commission e.g. in case of Himachal Pradesh , it is Himachal Pradesh Public Service Commission . As stated earlier , persons inducted into the State Service of a particular State can not be transferred to any other State . These officers are concerned with only the affairs of the state in which they are appointed . These services ( like HPAS , HPFS ) may , for convenience , be called as Superior Services/Higher Services with reference to a State . But in addition to these higher services , there are also services that may , again for convenience , be called as Subordinate Services/Lower Level Jobs . The posts in these services are like those of Clerks , School Teachers ; Drivers , Attendants , Safai Workers , etc . For the purpose of recruitment of Subordinate Servants , states have in place State-specific Selection Commissions . 54
