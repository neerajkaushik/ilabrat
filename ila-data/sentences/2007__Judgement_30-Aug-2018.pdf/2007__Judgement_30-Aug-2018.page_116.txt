President acting through an administrator . As held by this Court in New Delhi Municipal Council v. State of Punjab & Ors . ( 1997 ) 7 SCC 339 , the President , who is the executive head of a Union Territory while administering the Union Territory , does not function as the head of the Central Government , but as the head of the Union Territory under powers specially vested in him under Article 239 of the Constitution thereby occupying a position analogous to that of a Governor in a State . Though the Union Territories are centrally administered under the provisions of Article 239 , they do not become merged with the Central Government as has been held by this Court in Satya Dev Bushahri v. Padam Dev and Ors . AIR 1954 SC 587 . They are centrally administered ; but they retain their independent identity [ Chandigarh Administration and Anr . v. Surinder Kumar and Ors . ( 2004 ) 1 SCC 530 ] . The Union Territory does not entirely lose its existence as an entity though large control is exercised by the Union of India . [ Government of NCT Delhi v. All India Central Civil Accounts , Jao 's Association and Ors . ( 2002 ) 1 SCC 344 ] 116
