Territory or a particular part thereof . There is no doubt that before the Presidential Orders were issued under Article 341 ( 1 ) or under Article 342 ( 1 ) , elaborate enquiries were made and only after such enquiries that the Presidential Orders were issued . While doing so , the Presidential Orders not only provided that even specified parts or groups of castes , races or tribes/tribal community could be Scheduled Castes/Tribes in a particular State/Union Territory but also made it clear that certain castes or tribes or parts/groups thereof could be Scheduled Castes/Tribes only in specified/particular areas/districts of a State/Union Territory . The reason for such an exercise by reference to specific areas of a State is that judged by standards of educational , social backwardness , etc. races or tribes may not stand on the same footing throughout the State . The consideration for specifying a particular caste or tribe or class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes or Backward Classes in any given State depends on the nature and extent of the disadvantages and social hardships 22
