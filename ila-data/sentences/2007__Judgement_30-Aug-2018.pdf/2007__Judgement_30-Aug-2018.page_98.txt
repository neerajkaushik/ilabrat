while Article 16 is the species , in E. P - Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu and Anr. , ( 1974 ) 4 SCC 3 , it was held that : " 85 . ee Article 16 embodies the fundamental guarantee that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State . Though enacted as a distinct and independent fundamental right because of its great importance as a principle ensuring equality of opportunity in public employment which is so vital to the building up of the new classless egalitarian society envisaged in the Constitution , Article 16 is only an instance of the application of the concept of equality enshrined in Article 14 .

The basic principle which , therefore , informs both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination . Now , what_is the content and reach of this great equalising principle ? It is a founding faith , to use the words of Bose . J. , “ a way of life ” , and it must _ not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach . We can not countenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning , for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude . Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and _ it can not be “ cribbed , cabined and confined ” within traditional and doctrinaire limits ........ " [ Underlining added ] 17 .
