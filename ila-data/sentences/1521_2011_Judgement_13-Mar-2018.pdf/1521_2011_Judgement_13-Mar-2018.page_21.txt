21 reproduce paragraphs 30 to 32 of the reported judgment , which read thus : “ 30 . In M.C. Mehta Vs. Union of India this Court developed the “ useless formality ” theory stating : ( SCCPP.246-47 , para 22 ) “ More recently Lord Bingham has deprecated the ‘ useless formality ’ theory in R.v. Chief Constable of the Thames Valley Police Forces , ex p Cotton ?? by giving six reasons . ( See also his article ‘ Should Public Law Remedies be Discretionary ? 1991 PL , p. 64 . ) A detailed and emphatic criticism of the ‘ useless formality theory ’ has been made much earlier in ‘ Natural Justice , Substance or Shadow ’ by Prof. D.H. Clark of Canada ( see 1975 PL , pp. 27-63 ) contending that Malloch and Glynn were wrongly decided . Foulkes ( Administrative Law , 8 Edn. , 1996 , p. 323 ) , Craig ( Administrative Law , 3 Edn. , p. 596 ) and others say that the Court can not prejudge what is to be decided by the decisionmaking authority . De Smith ( 5th Edn. , 1994 , paras 10.031 to 10.036 ) says courts have not yet committed themselves to any one view though discretion is always with the court . Wade ( Administrative Law , 5th Edn. , 1994 , pp. 526-30 ) says that while futile writs may not be issued , a distinction has to be made according to the nature of the decision . Thus , in relation to cases other than those relating to admitted or indisputable facts , there is a considerable divergence of opinion whether the applicant can be compelled to prove that the outcome will be in his favour or he has to prove a case of substance or if he can prove a ‘ real likelihood ’ of success or if he is entitled to relief even if there is some remote chance of success . We may , however , point out that even in cases where the facts are not all admitted or beyond dispute , there is a considerable unanimity that the courts can , in exercise of their ‘ discretion ’ , refuse certiorari , prohibition , mandamus or injunction even though natural justice is not followed . We may also state that there is yet another line of cases as in State Bank of Patiala Vs. S.K. Sharmal8 , Rajendra Singh Vs. State of M.P. 14 that even in relation to statutory provisions requiring notice , a distinction is to be made between cases where the provision is intended for individual benefit 12 ( 1990 ) IRLR 344 13 ( 1996 ) 3 SCC 364 14 ( 1996 ) 5 SCC 460
