3 conditions that may be imposed by this Court . 6 . Having heard the learned counsel on both sides , we are of the view that the condition imposed by the High Court , as per the impugned order , will not be sufficient in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case . The High Court has directed deposit of Rs. 50 Lakhs on the premise that the financial fraud involved in the case is around Rs. 50 Lakhs . Now that it has come out that the fraud is more than Rs. 2.75 Crores , we are of the view that some more stringent conditions should be imposed on the first respondent . 7 . Accordingly , this appeal is disposed of with the following directions : ( a ) The first respondent shall be released on bail on furnishing security to the satisfaction of the trial court for a further amount of Rs. 75 Lakhs , in addition to Rs. 50 Lakhs deposit , as directed by the High Court . ( b ) He shall deposit his passport with the trial court forthwith . ( c ) He shall also present himself at the jurisdictional police station once every week .
