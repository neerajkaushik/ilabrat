be ploughed back into the capital with the tacit consent of the participating Governments . Thereafter , it is stated that this has to be provided to the DVC as per the provisions of Section 38 of the DVC Act . It is thereafter paragraph A-16 which we have already extracted , the Tribunal proceeded to observe that under the DVC Act if there is any deficit in the capital contributed by the participating Governments , it is to be made good by taking loan on behalf of the participating Governments . The said debt would attract interest . The average interest rate of the repayment payable is to be applied on a 50:50 normative debt capital . This means that out of the aggregate equity including reserves , equity considering the normative debt ratio of 50:50 would be eligible for return on equity as specified in the Regulations and the excess of equity , if any , over the equity earning ratio of 14 % is to be considered as interest bearing debt . In the example which has been given it is shown that if the debt equity ratio is 40:60 , return on equity at 14 % will be available on 50 % equity 26
