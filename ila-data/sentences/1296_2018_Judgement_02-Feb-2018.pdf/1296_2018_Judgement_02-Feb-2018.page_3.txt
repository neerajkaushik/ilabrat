the order dated 21.4.2015 passed by this Court in W.P. ( C ) 6358/2014 and other connected matters . Accordingly , petition stands dismissed as withdrawn in view of above . ” 6 . It may be seen that the High Court of Delhi reserved the liberty to the appellants , while withdrawing the writ petition to challenge ’ the orders , which are now mentioned before the High Court of Allahabad . Therefore , it can not be said that there is delay of more than five years , while filing the writ petitions . It appears that the Writ Petitions have been filed within five months , apparently after obtaining the orders dated 21.04.2015 and 07.12.2015 . 7 . Therefore , the impugned order is set aside and the matter is remitted to the High Court for considering it afresh . 8 . Needless to say that the same may not be dismissed on the ground of delay and on the ground that the appellants had once approached the High Court of Delhi . 9 : The appeal is , accordingly , disposed of . 10 . Pending applications , if any , shall stand disposed of . 11 . There shall be no orders as to costs .
