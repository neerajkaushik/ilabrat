80 the benefit . The question posed and decided was indeed different . The said decision , which we have already discussed supra , however , indicates that while construing an exemption notification , the Court has to distinguish the conditions which require _ strict compliance , the non-compliance of which would render the assessee ineligible to claim exemption and those which require substantial compliance to be entitled for exemption . We are pointing out this aspect to dispel any doubt about the legal position as explored in this decision . As already concluded in para 50 above , we may reiterate that we are only concerned in this case with a situation where there is ambiguity in an exemption notification or exemption clause , in which event the benefit of such ambiguity can not be extended to the subject/assessee by applying the principle that an obscure and/or ambiguity or doubtful fiscal statute must receive a construction favouring the assessee .
