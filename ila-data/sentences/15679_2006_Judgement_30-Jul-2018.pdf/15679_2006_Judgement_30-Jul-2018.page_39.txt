39 passage from Justice G.P. Singh ’s treatise , summed up the following principles applicable to the interpretation of a taxing statute : “ @ ) % In interpreting a taxing statute , equitable considerations are entirely out of place . A taxing statute can not be interpreted on any presumption or assumption . A taxing statute has to be interpreted in the light of what is clearly expressed ; it can not imply anything which is not expressed ; it can not import provisions in the statute so as to supply any deficiency ; ( ii ) Before taxing any person , it must be shown that he falls within the ambit of the charging section by clear words used in the section ; and ( iii ) If the words are ambiguous and open to two interpretations , the benefit of interpretation is given to the subject and there is nothing unjust in a taxpayer escaping if the letter of the law fails to catch him on account of Legislature ’s failure to express itself clearly ” .
