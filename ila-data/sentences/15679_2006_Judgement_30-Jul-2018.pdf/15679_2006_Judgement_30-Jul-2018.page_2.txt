2 . provision / notification when there is an ambiguity as to its applicability with reference to the entitlement of the assessee or the rate of tax to be applied ? In Sun Export Case ( supra ) , a three-Judge Bench ruled that an ambiguity in a tax exemption provision or notification must be interpreted so as to favour the assessee claiming the benefit of such exemption . Such a rule was doubted when this appeal was placed before a Bench of two-Judges . The matter then went before a three-Judge Bench consisting one of us ( Ranjan Gogoi , J. ) . The threeJudge Bench having noticed the unsatisfactory state of law as it stands today , opined that the dicta in Sun Export Case ( supra ) , requires reconsideration and that is how the matter has been placed before this Constitution Bench .
