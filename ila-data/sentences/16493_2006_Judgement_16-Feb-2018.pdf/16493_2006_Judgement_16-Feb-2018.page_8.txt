the land and his access to the road would not have been affected , had that portion of the land been not allotted to Deoki Devi . This order virtually nullified the earlier order and , therefore , the appellant was well within his rights to challenge the order passed by the Settlement Officer , Consolidation in the appeal filed by Bansi Ballabh . It is well settled position of law that if an order adversely affects any party , he has a right to challenge it . The appellant was not a party to the appeal filed by Bansi Ballabh , but by the order passed by the Settlement Officer , Consolidation in the appeal filed by Bansi Ballabh , the appellant was virtually denied access to the road . Therefore , the Deputy Director , Consolidation was justified in entertaining the revision filed by the appellant herein and making re-allotments , as indicated hereinabove . 10 . It has been contended by the appellant that the original holding of Deoki Devi in Plot No. 319 was almost 2 kilometres away . It may be true that she has been allotted a smaller portion of land but the purpose of the Consolidation Act is to prevent fragmentation of a holding and to have one common holding . The Deputy Director , Consolidation rightly allowed the revision .
