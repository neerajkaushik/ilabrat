necessary ; ( ii ) the construction put up by the first respondent are industrial buildings and not commercial establishments ; and ( iii ) the first respondent is situated in Bengaluru Rural ( North ) District and it is not situated in Bengaluru Urban District attracting levy of such higher fee . 34 . By careful perusal of the first respondent â€™s response dated 16.10.1998 , it is seen that the first respondent has not challenged the jurisdiction of appellant-Authority to levy betterment charges and that the objections that the first respondent has raised were regarding the rate of betterment fee treating the first respondent as commercial establishment and the fact that they are situated in Bengaluru Rural ( North ) District and not in Bengaluru Urban District . When the first respondent has not raised the objection regarding the jurisdiction/competence of the appellant-Authority to levy betterment fee , the first respondent was not justified in turning around and challenging the powers of the appellant-Planning Authority to levy betterment charges . The High Court , in our view , did not properly consider the response of the first respondent and the High Court erred in saying that the role of KTCP is only to scrutinise the application to ensure that the plan is in conformity with the provisions of the KTCP Act and that it can not levy the fee . 26
