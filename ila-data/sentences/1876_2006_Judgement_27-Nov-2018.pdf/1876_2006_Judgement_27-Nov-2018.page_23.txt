both the Acts make the intention of the legislature very clear . As rightly submitted by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that if there are two possible interpretations of an enactment , one should avoid the construction which would reduce the legislation to futility and should rather accept the broader interpretation . A statute is designed to be workable and the interpretation thereof by the court should be to secure that object . In so far as the “ industrial area ” allotted by KIADB , the interpretation given by the High Court to the provisions of KTCP Act would render the existence of the Planning Authority like the appellant to futility . While on the one hand , the High Court has directed the first respondent to obtain permission from the Planning Authority under KTCP Act and that the appellantAuthority to scrutinise those plans only to ensure that they are in conformity with the Regulations etc . At the same time , the High Court is saying that the appellant-Authority can not collect the betterment fees . In our considered view , such findings are contradictory to each other and can not be sustained . 31 . The High Court held that KIAD Act being a Special Act , the same will prevail over KTCP Act which is a General Act . KTCP Act is applicable to all the developmental activities in respect of any land coming within the area of Outline Development Plan ( ODP ) 23
