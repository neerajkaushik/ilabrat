35 . It is also pertinent to note that for obtaining sanction of their plan , the other allottees of industrial plots by KIADB have paid the betterment charges and also the road cess as demanded by the appellant-Authority . In this regard , the learned senior counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention to the communication from ITC Limited including the Pay Order dated 01.08.1997 for payment of betterment charges of Rs. 3,01,71,600 / - . When other allottees of industrial plots by KIADB have paid betterment charges and road cess for obtaining sanction of the plan , the first respondent can not challenge the levy and contend that they are not liable to pay the betterment charges . 36 . The High Court , in our view , ignored the important provisions of KTCP i.e. Sections 14 and 15 regarding the development act and the development activities including the industrial areas fall within the scope of the appellant-Authority and that the first respondent while obtaining the approval from the appellant-Authority for its plan is bound to pay the betterment charges , road cess and other charges as per the laws . The learned Single Judge has rightly dismissed the writ petition filed by the first respondent and the Division Bench erred in reversing the same and the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside . 27
