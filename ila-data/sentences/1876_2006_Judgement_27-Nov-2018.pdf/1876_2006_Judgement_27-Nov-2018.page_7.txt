empowering the appellant to charge the betterment fees . It was submitted that the areas of operation of KTCP Act and KIAD Act are entirely different with different aims and objectives and therefore , the principle of interpretation of “ special Act prevails over general Act ” ( Generalia Specialibus Non Derogant ) would have no application and the same has been wrongly applied by the High Court and the Division Bench erred in reversing the judgment of the Single Judge . 9 . Per contra , Mr. Bharat Sangal , learned counsel for the first respondent submitted that once the area is allotted to KIAD Board , the acquisition and the allotment being for industrial purpose which involves the change of land use and its development is controlled by the KIAD Board and the provisions of KIAD Act and it falls outside the purview of KTCP Act . The learned counsel for the first respondent further submitted that KIAD being a Special law , it will override the provisions of Sections 14 , 15 and 18 of KTCP Act anda general law like KTCP Act can not defeat the provisions of the special Law to the extent to which they are in conflict . The learned counsel further submitted that the moment the land was acquired for industrial purpose , it assumes the character of industrial area and no further conversion and development is required and hence , there is no question of conversion fee/betterment fee be paid to KTCP 7
