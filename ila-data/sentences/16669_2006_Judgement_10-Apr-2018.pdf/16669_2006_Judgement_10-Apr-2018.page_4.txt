6 . The contention of defendant no. 2 is that the suit land had already been mutated in his favour on the basis of the aforesaid Will . It is clear from the materials on record that certain proceeding under Section 145 of the Cr.P.C . were initiated by defendant No. 1 against defendant No. 2 in relation to the land in question . Since the said proceedings did not determine the title or ownership in the land , the second defendant filed a revenue suit under Sections 88 and 183 of the Tenancy Act against the first defendant . In these proceedings , the aforesaid Will was produced . There was yet another proceeding between the parties . In the said proceedings it was concluded that defendant no. 2 was in possession of the property in question . There was yet another proceeding in relation to the record of Samvat Year 2057 to 2060 corresponding to the year 2000 to 2003 . On the basis of the judgment and decree of the Revenue Court in favour of the appellant-defendant , possession was also given by the Tehsildar on 25.4.1997 . Relying on these two orders of the competent court , the High Court has concluded that second defendant is the owner and in possession of the property on the basis of the Will . We do not find any error in the aforesaid finding . The High Court , in our view , has rightly denied specific performance of the agreement in favour of the plaintiff and directed refund of the amount by the first defendant with interest @ 6 % p.a . In view of our conclusion as above , it is unnecessary to consider the other contentions of the parties .
