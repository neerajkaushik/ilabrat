17 Municipal Corporation will be left with no other option but to take recourse to statutory remedies for recovery of its dues from HPTDC in relation to the subject premises . Since the State has also come up in appeal against the decision of the High Court , it must take initiative to find out a suitable solution in accordance with law , expeditiously and within a reasonable time , failing which it may be open to the Municipal Corporation to resort to recovery proceedings against HPTDC and including eviction of HPTDC from the suit premises consequent to termination of the contract inter partes . 14 . In light of these observations , nothing would survive for consideration in the writ petition as filed before the High Court , which is still pending for final decision . As a result , besides setting aside the impugned judgment and orders dated 24th May , 2005 and 5St July , 2005 , respectively , we are inclined to dispose of the said writ petition with the aforementioned observations . Thus , the Writ Petition No. 555 of 2004 , filed in the High Court of Himachal Pradesh at Shimla , be deemed to have been disposed of accordingly .
