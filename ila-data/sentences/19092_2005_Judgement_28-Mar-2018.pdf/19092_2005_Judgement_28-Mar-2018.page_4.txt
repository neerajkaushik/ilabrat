4 differences between the Municipal Corporation and HPTDC regarding the rent were resolved in terms of the award passed by the Secretary ( LSG ) to the Government of Himachal Pradesh . The Municipal Corporation and HPTDC were bound by the said award , whereunder enhanced rent in respect of the subject properties was specified . The Municipal Corporation in its meeting held on 20 July , 1988 , had taken a decision regarding the increase of rent payable by HPTDC . The thrust of the stand taken by the State was that HPTDC , being a State Corporation , was obliged to engage in promoting tourism within the State and in terms of the tourism policy of the State , the directions given by the State were required to be carried out by HPTDC . The possession of the subject premises by the HPTDC can not be equated with a private lease or occupation by a private individual , as the activities of the HPTDC were to effectuate the larger public interest and tourism within the State . Significantly , the lease agreement between HPTDC and the Municipal Corporation was still subsisting .
