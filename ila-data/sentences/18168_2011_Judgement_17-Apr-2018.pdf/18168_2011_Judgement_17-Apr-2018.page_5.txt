confirmed the judgment and decree of the Trial Court . 9 . It may be mentioned here that one question was also raised by the parties in the case , namely , whether any case under Section 20 ( 4 ) read with its proviso was made out by the parties or not ? 10 . It was the case of the plaintiff ( landlord ) that the defendant is not entitled to take any benefit of Section 20 ( 4 ) of the Act to avoid the decree of eviction passed against him under Section 20 ( 2 ) ( a ) of the Act because his son , who is a member of the tenant ’s family , as defined under Section 3 ( g ) of the Act , has built his own house in the same city and hence the defendant ’s case would fall under proviso to Section 20 ( 4 ) of the Act which would make Section 20 ( 4 ) inapplicable to the tenant . The defendant opposed this contention on facts stating that his son lives separately from him and hence proviso will not apply . The contention of the plaintiff was upheld by the Revisional Court ( ADJ )
