38 . We , however , make it clear that we have not applied our mind to the merits of the controversy involved in the appeals , but only formed an opinion to remand the case due to the infirmity noticed in the manner in which the second appeal was decided . The High Court will , therefore , decide the second appeal uninfluenced by any of our observations made in this order . 39 . Since the matter is quite old , we request the High Court to decide the second appeal expeditiously preferable within six months from the date of receipt of this judgment . cone sesrepccwnemaeum a asoncamonsceerara LL [ R.K.
