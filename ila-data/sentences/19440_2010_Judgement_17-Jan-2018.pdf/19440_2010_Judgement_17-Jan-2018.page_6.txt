( iv ) ( v ) 9 . 6 deposed that Gian Chand ( PW 9 ) left the spot to bring scale and weights at 1 a.m . According to Anjani Kumar ( PW 12 ) , he called Rajinder Kumar ( PW11 ) on his cell phone and asked to join him at Kullu whereas the record shows that Rajinder Kumar ( PW 11 ) joined PW 12 at Panarsa and he has clearly denied to have received any call from PW 12 . It is the case of the accused â€” respondents that while they were taking tea at a Dhaba , police arrived there and taken them to police station and falsely implicated them in the case . This fact corroborates with the deposition of Bihari Lal ( DW 3 ) , a tea vendor , who stated that police officials came to his shop and took away the accused on 11-7-2004 . Besides the above noted inadequacies , there are also certain other contradictory statements by the prosecution witnesses relating to other aspects of the case , per se , according to Rakesh Kumar ( PW8 ) , he carried the report ( Ex.PH ) to police station in a truck , whereas PW-9 ( Gaian Chand ) states that PW8 travelled by a scooter and the prime witness Anjani Kumar ( PW12 ) says that PW8 went to police station and returned to the spot by foot .
