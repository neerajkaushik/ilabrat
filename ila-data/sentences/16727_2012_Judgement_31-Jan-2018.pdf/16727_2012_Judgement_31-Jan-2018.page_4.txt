needed the services of Technical Assistants and therefore there was no reason why his services were not extended . 6 . It is settled law that no contract employee has a right to have his or her contract renewed from time to time . That being so , we are in agreement with the Central Administrative Tribunal and the High Court that the petitioner was unable to show any statutory or other right to have his contract extended beyond 30 " June , 2010 . At best , the petitioner could claim that the concerned authorities should consider extending his contract . We find that in fact due consideration was given to this and in spite of a favourable recommendation having been made , the All India Institute of Medical Sciences did not find it appropriate or necessary to continue with his services on a contractual basis . We do not find any arbitrariness in the view taken by the concerned authorities and therefore reject this contention of the petitioner . 7 . We are also in agreement with the view expressed by the Central Administrative Tribunal and the High Court that the petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of the decision of this Court in Uma Devi . There is nothing on record to indicate that the appointment of the petitioner on a contractual basis or on an ad hoc basis was made in accordance with any regular procedure or by following the necessary rules . That being so , no right accrues in favour of the petitioner for regularisation of his services . S.L.P. ( C ) Nos. 22475-22476 of 2012 Page 4of 5
