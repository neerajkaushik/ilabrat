for delivery at the time and place of removal , namely , the factory gate . Where the _ price contemplated under the old Section 4 ( a ) or under the new Section 4 ( 1 ) ( a ) is not ascertainable , the price is determined under the old Section 4 ( b ) or the new Section 4 ( 1 ) ( b ) . Now , the price of an article is related to its value ( using this term in a general sense ) , and into that value have poured several components , including those which have enriched its value and given to the article its marketability in the trade . Therefore , the expenses incurred on account of the several factors which have contributed to its value upto the date of sale , which apparently would be the date of delivery , are liable to_be included . Consequently , where the sale is effected at the factory gate , expenses incurred by the assessee upto the date of delivery on account of storage charges , outward handling charges , interest on inventories ( stocks carried by the manufacturer after clearance ) , charges for other services after delivery to the buyer , namely aftersales service and marketing and _ selling organisation expenses including advertisement expenses can not be deducted . It will be noted that advertisement expenses , marketing and _ selling organisation expenses and _ after-sales service promote the marketability of the article and enter into its value in the trade . Where the sale in the course of wholesale trade is effected by the assessee through its sales organisation at a place or places outside the factory gate , the expenses incurred by the assessee upto the date of delivery under the aforesaid heads can not , on the same grounds , be deducted . But the assessee will be entitled to a deduction on account of the cost of transportation of the excisable article from the factory gate to the place or places where it is sold . The cost of transportation will include the cost of insurance on the freight for transportation of the goods from the factory gate to the place or places of delivery . ‚Äù ( Underlining is ours ) 23
