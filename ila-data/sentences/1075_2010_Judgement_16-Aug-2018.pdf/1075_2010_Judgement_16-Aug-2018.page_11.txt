case of the prosecution can not be allowed to rest on a preponderance of probabilities . 11 . A fair trial to an accused , a constitutional guarantee under Article 21 of the Constitution , would be a hollow promise if the investigation in a NDPS case were not to be fair or raises serious questions about its fairness apparent on the face of the investigation . In the nature of the reverse burden of proof , the onus will lie on the prosecution to demonstrate on the face of it that the investigation was fair , judicious with no circumstances that may raise doubts about its veracity . The obligation of proof beyond reasonable doubt will take within its ambit a fair investigation , in absence of which there can be no fair trial . If the investigation itself is unfair , to require the accused to demonstrate prejudice will be fraught with danger vesting arbitrary powers in the police which may well lead to false implication also . Investigation in such a case would then become an empty formality and a farce . Such an interpretation therefore naturally has to be avoided . 11
