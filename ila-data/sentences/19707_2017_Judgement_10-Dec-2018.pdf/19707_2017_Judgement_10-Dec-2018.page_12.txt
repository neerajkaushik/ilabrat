12 is not permissible under law . We , therefore , set aside the impugned order and allow the appeal . ” Dismissing the appeals , this Court observed as follows : " .... It is manifest from the aforeextracted order of the Tribunal that no details of any contemporaneous imports or any other material indicating the price notified by LME had either been referred to by the adjudicating officer in the adjudication order or such material was placed before the Tribunal at the time of hearing of the appeal . The learned counsel for the Revenue has not been able to controvert the said observations by the Tribunal . In that view of the matter no fault can be found with the order passed by the Tribunal setting aside the additional demand created against the assessee . ” 15 ) We , thus , do not find any merit in these appeals and dismiss the same . ssessesssuessucsssuessesssessseessnessseess J.
