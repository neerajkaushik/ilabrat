Rs. 3,500 per month out of which , an amount of Rs. 3,000 was being spent for household expenditure ; iv . Accordingly , an amount of Rs. 16,34,600 should have been awarded to the appellants . 6 Having considered the record , we are of the view that the assessment of income by the MACT at Rs 1,200 per month is on the lower side .
