22 . In Mulla v. State of Uttar Pradesh ® this Court specifically noted in paragraph 80 of the Report that one of the factors that appears to have been left out in judicial decision-making on the issue of sentencing , is the socioeconomic factor which is a mitigating factor although it may not dilute the guilt of the convict . This is what this Court held : “ 80 . Another factor which unfortunately has been left out in much judicial decision-making in sentencing is the socioeconomic factors leading to crime . We at no stage suggest that economic depravity justify moral depravity , but we certainly recognise that in the real world , such factors may lead a person to crime . The 48th Report of the Law Commission also reflected this concern . Therefore , we believe , socio-economic factors might not dilute guilt , but they may amount to mitigating circumstances . Socio-economic factors lead us to another related mitigating factor i.e. the ability of the guilty to reform . It may not be misplaced to note that a criminal who commits crimes due to his economic backwardness is most likely to reform . This Court on many previous occasions has held that this ability to reform amounts to a mitigating factor in cases of death penalty . ” ( Emphasis supplied by us ) . 23 . In Kamleshwar Paswan vy . Union Territory of Chandigarh ? this Court noted the fact that the convict was a rickshaw puller and a migrant with psychological and economic pressures . The socio-economic condition of the convict was therefore taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing him . It was held in paragraph 8 of the Report as follows : 8 ( 2010 ) 3 SCC 508 9 ( 2011 ) 11 SCC 564 R.P. ( Crl . ) No. 245 of 2010 in Crl . Appeal No. 811 of 2009 Page 13 of 19
