10 9 . Realising this position , an alternative plea has been taken by the appellant Association that the members of the appellant Association appointed on or before 31st March , 2013 and who are still serving as Assistant Public Prosecutors , if continued till 60 years , are willing to forego their pension , without any demur , for the extra period of service which will accrue from the age of 56 years till 60 years . The argument , though attractive , can not be the basis to issue such direction to the State Government . We agree with the respondent State that accepting this offer would create anomaly , discrimination and hardship to the rest of the government employees appointed prior to 1st April , 2013 as they all will retire at the age of 56 years . In any case , this is a policy matter . It is best left to the State Government . It will be a different matter if the Government accepts the offer given by the appellant on behalf of its members . We express no opinion in that behalf . It is open to the appellant to make a representation to the concerned State authority who will be free to take an appropriate decision as may be advised and permissible in law . We say no more .
