9 March , 2013 and those who joined on or after 1st April , 2013 , the said contention is also devoid of merits inasmuch as the conditions of service of the concerned set of Assistant Public Prosecutors is distinct . In that , those appointed on or before 31st March , 2013 are governed by the statutory pension scheme under the Service Rules as in the case of other government employees ; and those appointed on or after 1st April , 2013 are governed by the new Contributory Pension Scheme made applicable to all the government employees and not limited to Assistant Public Prosecutors . Assistant Public Prosecutors are only a small section of the genre of State Government employees â€” be it appointed prior to 31st March , 2013 or on or after 1st April , 2013 , either governed by statutory Pension Scheme or the new Contributory Pension Scheme , as the case may be . Be it noted , the cut-off date of 1st April , 2013 for introducing the new Contributory Pension Scheme by the State Government is not the subject matter of challenge in the present case .
