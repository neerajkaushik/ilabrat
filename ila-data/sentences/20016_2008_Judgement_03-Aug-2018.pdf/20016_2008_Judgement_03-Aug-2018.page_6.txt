aspects of this case are to be concentrated which may indicate whether the prosecution was able to prove the case beyond reasonable doubts . 7 . The first aspect , we need to consider is that the inadequacy of Test Identification Parade [ hereinafter referred as ‘ TIP ’ for brevity ] has been conducted herein . Though it is a case of the prosecution that the dacoits were armed with a gun , the country made pistol , lathis and bamboos etc. , but none of these weapons were recovered from the accused persons except a piece of dhoti , blouse and nose stud , other articles alleged to have been stolen by the dacoits were not recovered . It is borne out of the record that the accused-Nand Kishore Singh and Maheshwar Singh were not subjected to T.I.P . The only person who was subjected to T.I.P. was a minor ( Mintu Singh ) . It may be of some relevance to note that aforesaid Mintu Singh who has identified during the T.I.P. was referred to Juvenile Justice Board , as he was found to be a Juvenile . In this context we may note that in cases like present one T.I.P. acquires significance and lack of conduction of the same can not be ignored . It is well settled that non-conduction of T.I.P. may not itself be fatal to the prosecution case but certainly it must be weighed in by the Court while considering the facts and circumstances of each case .
