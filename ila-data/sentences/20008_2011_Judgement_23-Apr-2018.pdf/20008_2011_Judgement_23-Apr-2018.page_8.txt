held by the Teachers belonging to Category II or III may be declared by the University with the prior approval of the Board as equivalent to the teaching posts . A plain reading of Statute 19 would show that Field Supervisors who fall in Category II claiming to be Teachers have to be declared by the University as Teachers . The finding recorded by the full Bench that Statute 19 ( 3 ) does not apply to persons falling in Category II is not correct . Interpreting Category Ill of Statute 19 ( 1 ) to be the only category where there is requirement of declaration by the Statutes as Teachers , the full Bench lost sight of the scope of Statute 19 ( 3 ) wherein a provision pertaining to a declaration in respect of persons falling in Category Il and Category IIl as Teachers is clearly mentioned . We are of the opinion that a post of Field Supervisor can be treated as a Teacher only after a declaration by the University with the prior approval of the Board and not otherwise . 7 . It is well settled that the relief to be granted in a case is not a natural consequence of the ratio of the judgment ( Sanjay Singh & Anr . v. U.P Public â€™ Service Commission , Allahabad & Anr . ? ) . \ t can be noticed from 2 ( 2007 ) 3 SCC 720 - para 10
