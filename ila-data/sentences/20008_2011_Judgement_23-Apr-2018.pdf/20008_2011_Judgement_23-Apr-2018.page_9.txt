the narration above , the proceeding dated 16 " March , 1979 of Registrar of the University declaring the post of Field Supervisor as Teacher for the purpose of Elections has neither been withdrawn nor rescinded till date . The recommendation made by the Registrar of the University on 26 March , 1981 to the Government to treat the Field Supervisor as Teachers still holds good . We are in agreement with the judgment in Upendra Nath Patra ’s case ( Supra ) on this point . It is not open to the University to contend that no reliance can be placed by the Respondents on the proceeding dated 16 March , 1979 of Registrar of the University as it was issued by the Registrar who was not competent to issue such orders . We also accept the logic of the Division Bench of the High Court in Upendra Nath Partra ’s case ( Supra ) that the declaration of a Teacher for one purpose will hold good for the others too . 8 . We are informed that the Respondents have retired from service and have been fighting for their rights for nearly 30 years . We do not see any reason to prevent the Respondents from getting the benefits of their being treated as Teachers . We make it clear that this would not deter the University from withdrawing the proceeding dated
