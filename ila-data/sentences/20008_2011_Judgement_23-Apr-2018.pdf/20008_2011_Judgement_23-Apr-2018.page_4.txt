Assistant and Field Supervisor should be treated as Teachers provided the incumbents were post-graduates . In its judgment in OJC No. 2412 of 1985 , the Division Bench also took note of an Office Order dated 16 " March , 1979 of the Registrar of the University by which the post of Field Supervisor was declared as Teacher under Section 19 ( 1 ) of the Statutes framed under the Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology Act , 1965 ( for short ‘ the Act ’ ) . The Appellant ’s contention that the declaration of the post of Field Supervisor as Teacher under Statute 19 ( 1 ) of the Statutes was only for the limited purpose of inclusion in the electoral roll in connection with the election to the post of Member from the Teachers Constituency to the Board of Management was rejected . The High Court repelled the contention that the Registrar of the University had no jurisdiction to pass an Order of equivalence and it is only the Board of Management which had the competence to do so . The High Court held that the proceeding dated 16 " March , 1979 has neither been superseded nor cancelled . The High Court concluded that a Field Supervisor can not be declared as equivalent to a Teacher for a limited purpose .
