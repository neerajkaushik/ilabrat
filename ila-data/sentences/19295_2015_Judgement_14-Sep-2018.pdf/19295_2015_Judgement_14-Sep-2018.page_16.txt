16 scientists of ISRO but also arrested them while they were working on a crucial space programme , was an unpardonable lapse . It is pointed out that if the action of the Government of Kerala is not interfered with on the ground of delay , it would tantamount to taking advantage of one ’s own wrong doing and further adding a premium to an unpardonable fault . 27 . Learned counsel for the respondent no. 4 has submitted that the conduct of the police officials is criminal in nature as per the investigation and report submitted by the CBI and the investigation of the CBI had clearly established that the investigation carried out by the State police was full of lapses and also involved employment of illegal means such as criminal torture . The stand of the respondents is that the report is recommendatory but it was incumbent upon the State of Kerala to act upon the same as that would have reflected an apposite facet of constitutional governance and respect for individual liberty and dignity . Relying upon the judgment of this Court in Japani Sahoo v. Chandra Sekhar Mohanty ’ , it is submitted that the State of Kerala could not take shelter of the doctrine of delay and laches . The erring conduct of the police officers is of criminal nature and justice can be meted out to the appellant only by taking appropriate action against the said officers along with payment of compensation for the humiliation and disgrace suffered by the victim . 2 ( 2007 ) 7 SCC 394
