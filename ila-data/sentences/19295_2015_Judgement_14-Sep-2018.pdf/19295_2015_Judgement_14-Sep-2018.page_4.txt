7 . The CBI in its report , as regards the role of the respondent no. 1 herein , went on to state : “ l , Sh . Siby Mathew was heading the Special Investigation Team and was , therefore , fully responsible for the conduct of investigation in the aforesaid two cases . Investigation conducted by the CBI has revealed that he did not take adequate steps either in regard to the thorough interrogations of the accused persons by Kerala Police or the verification of the so called disclosure made by the accused persons . In fact , he left the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties . He ordered indiscriminate arrest of the ISRO scientist and others without adequate evidence being on record . It stressed that neither Sh . Siby Mathew and his team recovered any incriminating ISRO documents from the accused persons nor any monies alleged to have been paid to the accused persons by their foreign masters . It was __ unprofessional_on his part to have ordered indiscriminate arrest to top ISRO scientists who played a key role in successful launching of satellite in the space and thereby caused avoidable mental and_physical agony to them . It is surprising that he did not take any steps at his own level to conduct investigation on the points suggested by him . Since Sh . Mathew was based at Trivandrum , there was no justification for not having the searches conducted in the officials ’ residential premises of the accused Nambi Narayanan was arrested by the Kerala Police on 30.11.1994 . Vi . Shri Siby Mathew and his team miserably failed even in conducting verification of the records of Hotels viz. , Hotel foret Manor , Hotel Pankaj , Hotel Luciya , etc. , which were located at Trivandrum _ to ascertain the veracity of the statement of accused persons ... . The above facts are being brought to the notice of the competent authority for their kind consideration and for such action as deemed fit . [ Emphasis added ]
