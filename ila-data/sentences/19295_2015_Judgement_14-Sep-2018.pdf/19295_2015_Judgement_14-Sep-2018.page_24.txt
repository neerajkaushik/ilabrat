24 “ The sum and substance of the aforesaid statements is that ISRO does not have a system of classifying drawings/documents . In other words , the documents/drawings are not marked as Top Secret , Secret , Confidential or Classified etc . Further , ISRO follows an open-door policy in regard to the issue of documents to the scientists . Since ISRO is a research-oriented organisation , any _ scientist wanting to study any document is free to go to the Documentation Cell/Library and _ study the documents . As regards the issue of documents to various Divisions , the procedure was that only the copies used to be issued to the various divisions on indent after duly entering the same in _ the Documentation Issue Registers . During investigation , it has been revealed that various drawings running into 16,800 sheets were issued to the Fabrication Division where accused Sasi Kumaran was working , and after his transfer to SAP , Ahmedabad on 7-11-1994 , all the copies of the drawings were found to be intact . Nambi Narayanan being a senior scientist , though had access to the drawings , but at no stage any drawings/documents were found to have been issued to him . They have also stated that it was usual for scientists to take the documents/drawings required for any meetings/discussions to their houses for study purposes . In these circumstances , the allegation that Nambi Narayanan and Sasi Kumaran might have passed on the documents to a third party , is found to be false . ” It further appears that at the instance of CBI , a Committee of senior scientists was constituted to ascertain whether any classified documents of the organisation were stolen or found missing and _ their report shows that there were no such missing documents . There can not , therefore , be any scope for further investigation in respect of purported espionage activities in that organisation in respect of which only the Kerala Police would have jurisdiction to investigate ;
