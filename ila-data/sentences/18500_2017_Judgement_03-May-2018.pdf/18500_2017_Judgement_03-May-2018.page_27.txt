alternative remedy . Placing reliance upon Arundhati Mishra ( Smt ) v. Sri Ram Charitra Pandey ( 1994 ) 2 SCC 29 , it was submitted that it is settled law that it is open to the parties to raise mutually inconsistent pleas and the relief could be granted on the alternative plea so raised . 30 . Refuting the above contentions , Mr. Shanti Bhushan , learned senior counsel for the appellants placed reliance upon Ayyasamy case to contend that there are no serious allegations in the plaint to decline reference of the matter to arbitration . It was submitted that mere allegations of fraud were not sufficient to detract from the performance of the obligation of the parties in terms of the agreement and refer the matter to arbitration . 31 . Under the Act , an arbitration agreement means an agreement which is enforceable in law and the jurisdiction of the arbitrator is on the basis of an arbitration clause contained in the arbitration agreement . However , in a case where the parties alleged that the arbitration agreement is vitiated on account of fraud , the Court may refuse to refer the parties to arbitration . In Ayyasamy case , this Court held that mere allegation of fraud is not a ground to nullify the effect of arbitration agreement between the parties and arbitration clause need not be avoided and parties can be relegated to arbitration where merely simple allegations of fraud touched upon internal affairs of parties is levelled . 27
