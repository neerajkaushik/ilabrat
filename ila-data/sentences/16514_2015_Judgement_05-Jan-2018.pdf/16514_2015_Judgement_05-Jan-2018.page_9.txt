workers were found working in the Unit of respondent No. 1 at the relevant time . 17 . There can be no dispute to the proposition that the question as to what is the total strength of the workers employed in the Unit or , in other words , how many workers were working in a particular unit is essentially a question of fact . Such question is required to be decided by the Courts on appreciation of evidence adduced by the parties . 18 . Once the Courts record a finding on such question , be that of concurrence or reversal , the finding is usually held binding on this Court while hearing the appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution . 19 . It is only when such finding is found to be against any provision of law or evidence or is found to be wholly perverse to the extent that no average judicial person could ever record such finding , it would not be held binding on the superior Court .
