the workers are entitled to receive from respondent No. 1 ( Company ) . 36 . Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 , however , stated that out of total workers , most of the workers have settled their claims by accepting the compensation offered by respondent No. 1 voluntarily . Learned counsel stated that the compensation paid to each worker consisted of ( i ) amount of Gratuity payable under the Payment of Gratuity Act , ( ii ) closure compensation payable under the I.D. Act , and over and above these two statutory payments of compensation , the respondent No. 1 also paid 30 days â€™ wages for each completed year of service as ex gratia payment to each worker . It was also stated that now hardly 16 workers or so remain unpaid because they did not accept the compensation when offered to them and preferred to prosecute the present litigation . ( 7 |
