16 the aforesaid provisions of IPC is concerned , the same is maintained and upheld . 6 . Reverting to the issue of death penalty , learned senior counsel submitted that the case did not fall under the category of rarest of rare cases and , therefore , the capital punishment was not a desirable punishment in the instant case . We have given our serious thoughts on this aspect . After examining the matter at length , we are of the opinion that the instant case would not fall in the category of rarest of rare cases and it would be in the interest of justice if the death sentence is commuted into life imprisonment . At the same time we are also of the opinion that life sentence should be with a cap of 20 years rigorous imprisonment ( RI ) which would mean that the appellant shall not be entitled to make any representation for remission till he completes 20 years of RI . It is more so , keeping in view the age of the appellant who is at present more than 60 years of age , and has no history of any other criminal activity , possibility of reform , as the learned counsel for respondent-State could not point out blameworthy conduct depicted by him in jail . 7 . The appeal is partly allowed in the aforesaid terms . Insofar as sentences given under Sections 376 and 342 , IPC are concerned , those are maintained with clarification that all the sentences shall run concurrently .
