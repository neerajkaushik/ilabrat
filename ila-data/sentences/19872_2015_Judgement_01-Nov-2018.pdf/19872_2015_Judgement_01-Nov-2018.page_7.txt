7 not merely as a weapon for protecting the hegemony of one class over the other ( see p. 197 , para 6 of the Report ) . 48 . In Muniappan v. State of T.N. [ ( 1981 ) 3 SCC 11 : 1981 SCC ( Cri ) 617 ] Chandrachud , C.J. delivering the judgment again had to consider the importance of Section 235 ( 2 ) and Section 354 ( 3 ) CrPC in our sentencing procedure . The learned Chief Justice held that the obligation to hear the accused on the question of sentence under Section 235 ( 2 ) of the 1973 Code is not discharged by putting a formal question to the accused as to what he has to say on the question of sentence . The learned Chief Justice made it clear that the Judge must make a genuine effort to elicit from the accused all items of information which will eventually bear on the question of sentence .

To the same effect is the judgment of Ahmadi , J. ( as His Lordship then was ) in Allauddin Mian v. State of Bihar [ ( 1989 ) 3 SCC 5 : 1989 SCC ( Cri ) 490 ] . Explaining the purpose of Section 235 ( 2 ) , this Court in Allauddin Mian [ ( 1989 ) 3 SCC 5 : 1989 SCC ( Cri ) 490 ] held that Section 235 ( 2 ) satisfies a dual purpose ; first of all it satisfies rules of natural justice by according to the accused an opportunity of being heard on the question of sentence . Under such sentencing procedure the accused is given an opportunity to place before the court all relevant materials having a bearing on the question of sentence . The Court opined that it is a salutary principle and must be strictly observed and is not a matter of mere formality . This Court further held that in such hearing exercise the
