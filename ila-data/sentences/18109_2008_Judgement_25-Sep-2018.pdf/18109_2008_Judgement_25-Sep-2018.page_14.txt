19 ) Learned counsel elaborated this submission with reference to the actual findings of the Tribunal in the context of the wording of Section 3 ( 3 ) of the Act and especially the expression “ intended for cultivation by him ” occurring in sub-section ( 3 ) and contended that the facts found by the Tribunal do not satisfy the expression “ intended for cultivation by the landowners ” and , therefore , no reliance could be placed by the respondents on Section 3 ( 3 ) of the Act for claiming an exemption for their land from being vested in the State . 20 ) In reply , learned counsel for the respondents supported the impugned order and contended that it does not call for any interference . 21 ) Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on perusal of the record of the case , we find no merit in this appeal . 14
