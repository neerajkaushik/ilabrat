23 approximately 1,700 complaints were filed and about 168 election petitions have been instituted . We are emphatically of the view that any challenge to the election must take place in a manner which is known to law . 30 Under Section 79 ( 1 ) a period of 30 days is prescribed for instituting an election petition , where a dispute arises as to the validity of an election . The period of 30 days commences after the date of the declaration of the results of the election . The pendency of these proceedings may have dissuaded aggrieved individuals from seeking recourse to the remedy of an election petition , particularly after the interim order of this Court restraining the State Election Commission from notifying the results of the constituencies where there was no contest . While we are of the view that the validity of the elections must be tested in election petitions under Section 79 ( 1 ) , the question as to whether there was a large scale obstruction from filing nominations is a serious matter which needs to be resolved . This is particularly because even the Election Commission , as we have seen , had proceeded to take notice of the grim situation while extending the date for the filing of nominations . Having regard to the seriousness of the allegations and bearing in mind the fact that these proceedings were pending , we are of the view that it would be necessary to exercise the power under Article 142 of the Constitution to extend the period of 30 days for the filing of election petitions in respect of the uncontested seats .
