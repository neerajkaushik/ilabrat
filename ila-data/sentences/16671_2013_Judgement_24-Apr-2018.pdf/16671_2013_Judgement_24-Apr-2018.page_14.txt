and the demand drafts taken by the broker at the instance of the bank are sufficient to prove the fact that the Respondent acted as a broker to the Bank and , hence , the additional interest payable to the PSUs could not be held to be his property or income . 13 ) The income that has actually accrued to the Respondent is taxable . What income has really occurred to be decided , not by reference to physical receipt of income , but by the receipt of income in reality . Given the fact that the Respondent had acted only as a broker and could not claim any ownership on the sum of Rs. 14,73,91,000 / - and that the receipt of money was only for the purpose of taking demand drafts for the payment of the differential interest payable by Indian Bank and that the Respondent had actually handed over the said money to the Bank itself , we have no hesitation in holding that the Respondent held the said amount in trust to be paid to the public sector units on behalf of the Indian Bank based on prior understanding reached with the bank at the time of sale of securities and , hence , the said sum of Rs . 14,73,91,000 / - can not be termed as the income of the Respondent . 14
