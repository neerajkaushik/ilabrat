3 the State has drawn our attention to the evidence of PW-1 , Sub-inspector ( Ram Chandra Misra ) and PW-2 ( P.C. Sharma ) who in their evidence stated that the substance which was recovered and sealed were deposited in the Police Station Godown and later produced before the Court . Though the witnesses have stated that the substance was deposited in the Police Station Godown and later produced before the Court as pointed out by the High Court that there is no evidence to show that as to how and at what time and date the samples were taken by the carriers for analysis . It has also come on evidence that constables viz . Asharam and Karam Chand have taken the sample of charas and liquor packets respectively to the laboratory , were also not examined by the prosecution . 6 . The High Court has also pointed out that it was incumbent on the part of the prosecution to lead the evidence to show as to how and in what conditions the articles were preserved at the Police Station and how safely they were taken from there to the respective chemical examiners by its carriers . Learned counsel for the State has submitted that the investigating officer in this particular case has passed away and , therefore , the prosecution was handicapped in adducing the necessary evidence . Notwithstanding the death of the Investigating Officer , nothing prevented the prosecution from examining any other witness who was associated with the investigation and adducing necessary evidence to prove as to how and in what conditions the articles were preserved at the Police Station/Police Station Godown .
