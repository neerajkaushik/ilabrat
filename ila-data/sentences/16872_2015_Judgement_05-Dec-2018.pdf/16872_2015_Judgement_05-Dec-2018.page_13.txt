clothes of the deceased were recovered at the instance of the appellant , from a spot around 200m from Kamthekarwadi , from a pit which had been covered with a stone . This again is a location of which only the perpetrator of the offence could have had knowledge . Although it is true that the recovery of articles is to be made based on the statement of the accused immediately after the arrest of the accused and recording his statement , the recovery should be based on the voluntary action relating to showing of the place by the accused . Therefore , unless the accused volunteers to show the place of hiding certain things/facts , the recovery can not be made by the investigating officers . In this view of the matter , if the accused volunteered to show the place where he had hidden the deceased â€™s clothes at a particular place only after 5 days , the investigating officer can not be blamed for the same . In a given case , the accused may confess ten or fifteen days after his arrest and as such the recovery can not be suspected on this ground alone . Together , these circumstances establish that the appellant had hidden the body of the deceased , as well as her clothes , in a bid to suppress the evidence of his crime . 13
