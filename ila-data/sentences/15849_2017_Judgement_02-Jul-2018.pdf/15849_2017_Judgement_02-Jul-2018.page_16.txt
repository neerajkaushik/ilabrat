16 The very basis of the circular has been knocked out by the amendments made by Finance Act , 2002 . Thus , the Circular can not be relied by Noida/Greater Noida to contend that there is no requirement of deduction of tax at source under Section 194-I . Thus , deduction at source is on payment of rent under Section 194-I , which is clearly the statutory liability of the respondent-company . The High Court has adjusted the equities by recording its conclusion in Paragraph 20 and issuing a direction in Paragraph 21 . 17 . In view of what has been stated above , we do not find any error in the judgment of the High Court dated 16.02.2017 . In result , all the appeals are dismissed .
