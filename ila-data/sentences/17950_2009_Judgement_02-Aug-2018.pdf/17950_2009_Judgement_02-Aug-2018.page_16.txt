16 18 . In view of the foregoing discussion and having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we have no hesitation to conclude that the prosecution has proved the case against the accused â€” appellant beyond all reasonable doubts . We , therefore , find no infirmity or illegality in the impugned judgment passed by the High Court . Consequently , the appeal preferred by the accused being bereft of any substance , the same stands dismissed . ( S. ABDUL NAZEER ) NEW DELHI , August 02 , 2018 .
