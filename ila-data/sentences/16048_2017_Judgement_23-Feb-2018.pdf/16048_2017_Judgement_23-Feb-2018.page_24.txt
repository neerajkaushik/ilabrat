â€œ 3d Mr. Venugopal contended that the administration of justice both on civil and criminal side was being manned exclusively by the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants under the 1937 Rules . No other courts were functioning . Apart from administering criminal and civil justice the total administration of the district known as the Lushai Hills was vested in the Governor of Assam , the Deputy Commissioner of Lushai Hill , and his Assistants . The Deputy Commissioner under the 1937 Rules was competent to pass sentence of death , transportation or imprisonment up to a maximum provided for the offence and fine up to any amount . The Assistants to the Deputy Commissioner were to exercise such powers as conferred by the Governor not exceeding those of a magistrate of the first class as defined under the Code of Criminal Procedure . An appeal lies to the Deputy Commissioner against any order passed by any of his Assistants . Similarly under Rule 15 the administration of civil justice was entrusted to the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants . Srivastava exercised the powers of Assistant to the Deputy commissioner from June 23 , 1979 to December 19 , 1979 . According to Mr. Venugopal the office of the Assistant to which Srivastava was appointed for a period of about six months was a judicial office . According to him period for which he held the judicial office and _ the quality of the said office are not relevant factors . He therefore , forcefully contended that Srivastava , having held the judicial office of Assistant to the Deputy Commissioner under the 1937 Rules he fulfills the qualification under Article 217 ( 2 ) ( a ) read with ( a ) to the Explanation . 24
