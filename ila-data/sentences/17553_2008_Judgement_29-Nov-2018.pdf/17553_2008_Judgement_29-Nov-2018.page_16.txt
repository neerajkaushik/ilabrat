21 . 16 respondents/plaintiffs are the nearest cognates of Jagan Nath who had no surviving agnate . The High Court was perfectly right in interfering with this question of fact more so when the opinion of the 1 â€œ appellate court was perverse and contrary to material available on record . Issue is accordingly answered against appellants/defendants . In the light of the above findings on issues 1 and 2 we are of the considered opinion that the judgment and decree of the High Court requires no interference from this court . In the aforesaid circumstances the appeal of the defendants has to fail and accordingly appeal is dismissed by confirming the judgment and decree of the Trial Court , however , without costs . { G0 GE AAG Aaa ATE MAEG TONGA IRA RB ABARES J.
