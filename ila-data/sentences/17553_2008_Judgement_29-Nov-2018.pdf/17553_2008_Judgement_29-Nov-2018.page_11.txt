16 . 11 Singh nor are the defendants his cousins . DW-3 Sadhu Singh further stated that he never interacted with Jagan Nath prior to the execution of the said Will nor was he on visiting terms with him . It was admitted that the only relationship that existed between the parties was that of covillagers . It was also admitted that Jagan Nath was illiterate . DW-3 vaguely put forth the date of execution to be somewhere 11 years ago . The law regarding proof of valid Will is well settled by this Court in catena of judgments . Section 63 of the Indian Succession Act 1925 mandates that the Will shall be attested by two or more witnesses . As per Section 68 of the Evidence Act if only one attesting witness is alive the execution of the Will can be proved by only one attesting witness subject to the process of the Court and capable of giving evidence . In this case the only attesting witness DW-3 Sadhu Singh â€™s evidence does not inspire confidence in the mind of the Court and more so it creates suspicion in the mind of the Court with regard to execution and genuineness of the Will .
