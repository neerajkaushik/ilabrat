As indicated , charter parties which do not amount to a demise or lease of a ship ( Including time charters and voyage charters ) are classified in English law as contracts of affreightment , pursuant to which the owners agree to carry goods by sea in return for a sum of money . Although the charterers have a right as against the owners to have their goods carried on the vessel , the ownership and the possession of the ship remains with the owners through the master and crew who remain their servants . Whether or not a charter party amounts to a demise charter depends in every case upon the precise terms of the charter , taking the instrument as a whole . The test has been summarized as follows : “ The question depends , where other things are not in the way , upon this : whether the owner has by the charter , where there is a charter , parted with the whole possession and control of the ship , and to this extent , that he has given to the charterer a power and right independent of him , and without reference to him to do what he pleases with regard to the captain , the crew , and the management and employment of the ship . That has been called a letter or demise of the ship . The right expression is that it is a parting with the whole possession and control of the ship . ” Thus , although time charters almost always contain words such as “ let ” , “ hire ” , “ delivery ” and “ redelivery ” , the use of such words are inapt in such a context , and are not in any sense to be regarded as conclusive , when determining the nature of the charter . In Sea and Land Securities v. William Dickinson MacKinnon LJ traced the origin of these words to demise charters , and at page 163 emphasised the difference between demise and time charters thus : “ there is all the difference between hiring a boat Page 12 of 57
