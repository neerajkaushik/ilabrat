command and possession and consequent control over its navigation . Such a charter is called a bareboat charter . It would be apposite at this stage to refer to the Mark Davis ’ Commentary on “ Bareboat Charters ” 2 ” Edition where the nature and character of demised charters has been explained as follows : “ A fundamental distinction is drawn under English law between charter parties which amount to a demise or lease of a ship , and those which do not . The former category , known as charters by demise , operate as a lease of the ship pursuant to which possession and control passes from the owners to the charterers whilst the latter , primarily comprising time and voyage charters , are in essence contracts for the provision of services , including the use of the chartered ship . Under a lease , it is usual for the owners to supply their vessel “ bare ” of officers and crew , in which case the arrangement may correctly be termed a “ bareboat ” charter . The charterers become for the duration of the charter the de facto “ owners ” of the vessel , the master and crew act under their orders , and through them they have possession of the ship . A statement of the hallmarks of a demise charter can be found in the judgment of Evans LJ in The Giuseppe di Vittorio [ 1998 ] 1 Lloyd ’s Rep 136 at p 156 : “ What then is the demise charter ? Its hallmarks , as it seems to me , are that the legal owner gives the charterer sufficient of the rights of possession and control which enable the transaction to be regarded as a letting — a lease , or demise , in real property terms — of the ship . Closely allied to this is the fact that the charterer becomes the employer of the master and crew . Both aspects are combined in the common description of a ‘ bareboat ’ lease or hire arrangement . ” Page 11 of 57
