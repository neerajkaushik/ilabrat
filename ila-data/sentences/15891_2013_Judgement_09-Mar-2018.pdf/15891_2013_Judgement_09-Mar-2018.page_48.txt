charter , which is not a contract of hire but a contract of services , under which the possession remains in the owner and the master is the servant of the owner : see Sea & Land Securities Ltd. v. William Dickinson & Co. Ltd . [ 1942 ] 2 K.B. 65 , 69-70 per Mackinnon L.J. and Scrutton on Charterparties , 18th ed . ( 1974 ) , articles 24-26 . It is true that a demise charterer has in the past been described variously as “ owner pro hac vice : ” see , for example , Frazer v. Marsh ( 1811 ) 13 East 238 , 239 , per Lord Ellenbrough C.J. , The Lemington ( 1874 ) 2 Asp.M.L.C . 475 , 478 , per Sir Robert Phillimore , and The Tasmania ( 1888 ) 13 P.D. 110 , 118 , per Sir James Hannen P. ; or as a person who is “ for the time the owner of the vessel : ” see Sandeman v. Scurr ( 1866 ) L.R. 2 Q.B. 86 , 96 , per Cockburn C.J. ; or as a person with “ special and temporary ownership : ” see The Hopper No. 66 [ 1908 ] A.C. 126 , 136 , per Lord Atkinson . I doubt however if such language is much in use today ; and its use should not be allowed to disguise the true legal nature of a demise charter . Furthermore , no case has been drawn to my attention , and I am aware of more , in which a demise charterer has been described as a “ beneficial owner , ” still less as a “ beneficial owner as respects all the shares in the vessel . ” Indeed , any reference in this context to ownership “ as respects all the shares in the vessel ” is , in my judgment , inapt to describe the possession of a demise charterer ; such words are_only appropriate when describing ownership in the ordinary sense of the word , and not possession which is concerned with a physical relationship with the vessel founded upon control and has nothing to do with shares in the vessel . A demise charterer has , within limits defined by contract , the beneficial use of the ship ; he does not , however , have the beneficial ownership as respects all the shares in the ship . Furthermore , I can find nothing in the remainder of the statute to cause me to reject the natural and ordinary meaning of the words ; certainly , I would not construe other references in the statute to “ ownership ” — as in section 1 ( 1 ) ( a ) — or “ coowner ” — as in section 1 ( 1 ) ( b ) — as referring in any way to demise charterers . Indeed in Part V of the Act , which is Page 48 of 57
