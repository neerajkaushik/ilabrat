claim relating to that ship , the claimant may arrest such ship or any other ship in the ownership of the charterer by demise , subject to the provisions of this Convention , but no other ship in the ownership of the registered owner shall be liable to arrest in respect of such maritime claims . The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to any case in which a person other than the registered owner of a ship is liable in respect of a maritime claim relating to that ship . ” As I read the Convention , article 3 ( 1 ) , which is expressed to be subject to article 3 ( 4 ) , provides for the arrest of either the particular ship in respect of which the maritime claim arose , or ( except in certain specified cases ) any other ship which is owned by the person who was , at the time when the maritime claim arose , owner of the particular ship . Furthermore , despite the argument of Mr. Alexander for the plaintiffs to the contrary , in this context I read the word “ owner ” as bearing its ordinary meaning , that is , the person with title to the ship ; am confirmed in this view by the provision relating to ownership in article 3 ( 2 ) and by the fact that article 3 ( 4 ) , to which article 3 ( 1 ) is expressed to be subject , makes special provision for the case of the demise charterer and others . It is to be observed that , if one puts article 3 ( 4 ) on one side , the draftsman of the Act of 1956 appears to have been seeking to give effect to article 3 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of the Convention , subject to the fact that he appears to have been concerned to extend the word “ ownership ” by the addition of the adjective “ beneficial , ” very possibly to take account of the special English institution of the trust which may form no part of the domestic laws of other signatories to the Convention . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 59 .
