The charter agreement did contain a clause for conversion of the status into a de jure owner but the occasion for the same never arose . The option to purchase was to be exercised by an advance intimation of six months prior to the end of the charter period and the purchase price was also specified as US$ 3,01,50,000 . The charterer could not make any structural changes in the vessel or in the machinery , boilers , appurtenances or space parts thereof without first securing the owner â€™s approval and the vessel had to be restored to its former condition before the termination of the charter , if so required by the owners .
