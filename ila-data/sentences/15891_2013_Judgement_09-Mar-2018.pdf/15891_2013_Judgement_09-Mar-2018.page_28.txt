the appellant through a charter hire agreement and this can not form a part of the maritime claim against the respondent ship . In this behalf , reference has been made to the judgment in The “ Eschersheim ”’ . The relevant portion , which is also reproduced in the impugned judgment is extracted as under : 30 . “ In my opinion there is no good reason for excluding from the expression " an agreement for the use or hire of a ship " any agreement which an ordinary ASN 12/14 Appeal-209-13.doc business man would regard as being within it . If which an ordinary business man would regard as being within it . If A and B make an agreement for A 's ship to be used for carrying out any operation for B , I consider that the agreement is one for the use , if not for the hire of the ship . Thus an agreement for a ship to be employed for dredging , towing , cable laying and salvage would be an agreement for the use of the ship . But is an agreement for dredging or towage or cable laying or salvage an agreement for the use of a ship if there is no express reference in the agreement to any such use . If the operation can only be carried by means of a ship . I consider that the agreement must be one for the use or hire of a ship . A towage agreement would therefore always come within the words . Dredging or cable laying could conceivably be performed by other means but in the great majority of cases it would be so obvious that the use of a ship must be intended that this would be implied ..... ” Thus , the plea is that the charter hire agreement is for use of the appellant ’s vessel by Reflect Geophysical . The respondent is not liable personally for the maritime claim and , thus , there can be no arrest of the ship since the ship is not owned by Reflect Geophysical . The 6 [ 1976 ] Vol .
