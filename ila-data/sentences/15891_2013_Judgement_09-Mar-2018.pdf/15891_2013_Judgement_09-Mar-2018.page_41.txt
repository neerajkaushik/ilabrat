owner against whom the claim in personam lies and the owner of the ship . It can not be used to arrest a ship of a third party or a non-owner . 51 . As an illustrative example if we consider the principles of a garnishee order where amounts held by a third party on behalf of a defendant can be injuncted or attached to satisfy the ultimate claim , which may arise against the defendant . It is not as if somebody else ’s money is attached in pursuance to a garnishee ’s order . Similarly for a claim against the owner of the vessel , a vessel may be detained and not that somebody else ’s vessel would be detained for the said purpose . The crucial test would be of ownership , which in the present case clearly does not vest with Reflect Geophysical and the de facto ownership under their bareboat charter can not be equated to a de jure owner , which is necessary for an action in personam . 52 . We may note that for the purposes of determining the controversy , it is not really of much relevance that effectively no work was carried out under the agreements between the appellants and Reflect Geophysical as the chartered ship never commenced its task and never reached the port from where the task was to be commenced .
