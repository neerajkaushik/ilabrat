14 of ruination if a citizen feels , the truth uttered by a poor man is seldom listened to . Not for nothing it has been said that sun rises and sun sets , light and darkness , winter and spring come and go , even the course of time is playful but truth remains and sparkles when justice is done . It is the bounden duty of a court of law to uphold the truth and truth means absence of deceit , absence of fraud and in a criminal investigation a real and fair investigation , not an investigation that reveals itself as a sham one . It is not acceptable . It has to be kept uppermost in mind that impartial and truthful investigation is imperative . If there is indentation or concavity in the investigation , can the “ faith ” in investigation be regarded as the gospel truth ? Will it have the sanctity or the purity of a genuine investigation ? If a grave suspicion arises with regard to the investigation , should a constitutional court close its hands and accept the proposition that as the trial has commenced , the matter is beyond it ? That is the “ tour de force ” of the prosecution and if we allow ourselves to say so it has become “ idée fixe ” but in our view the imperium of the constitutional courts can not be stifled or smothered by bon mot or polemic . Of course , the suspicion must have some sort of base and foundation and not a figment of one ’s wild imagination . One may think an impartial investigation would be a nostrum but not doing so would be like playing possum . As has been stated earlier , facts are self-evident and the grieved protagonist , a person belonging to the lower strata . He should not harbour the feeling that he is an “ orphan under law ” . 12 . Suffice it to observe that we do not intend to deviate from the conclusion reached by the High Court that in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case , it is but appropriate that investigation of the crime in question must be entrusted to CBI .
