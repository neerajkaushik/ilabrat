The question for our consideration relates to the interpretation of Section 87 of the Andhra Pradesh ( Telangana Area ) Land Revenue Act , 1317 Fasli and the meaning of the expression ‘ clerical error ’ . The further question is whether a ‘ clerical error ’ can be corrected “ at any time ” or only within a reasonable time . 2 In our opinion , the correction sought to be made by the respondents is not a ‘ clerical error ’ and so the further question really does not arise . However , the expression “ at any time ’ can not be interpreted to stretch over a period of 25 years , as in the present case . C.A. Nos . / 2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos. 21856-21862 of 2010 ) Page 1 of 31
