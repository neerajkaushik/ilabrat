Locus standi 63 . It was submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that the APHB has no locus standi to raise any dispute with regard to the measurement of Survey No. 1009 . We are not at all in agreement with this submission . A tract of land measuring 11.10 acres out of Survey No. 1009 was sought to be taken away from the APHB which had announced a Housing Scheme under Section 22A of the Andhra Pradesh Housing Board Act , 1956 and third party rights had also been created in this regard . The primary responsibility of protecting the interests of the beneficiaries of the Housing Scheme was that of the APHB and surely it can not be said under these circumstances that the APHB had no locus standi to participate in the proceedings . In fact , even the revenue authorities recognised the locus of the APHB in the order dated 15 " September , 1997 . The Commissioner of Survey , Settlements and Land Records , Hyderabad directed the District Revenue Officer to take action in terms of the Circular of 15 " October , 1994 but before passing any orders under Section 87 of the Act , it was directed that the APHB should be heard . We therefore reject the contention that the APHB had no locus standi in the matter . Interference on facts 64 . The final submission of learned counsel for the respondents was C.A.
