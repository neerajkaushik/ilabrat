petition , they could have made a claim at any point of time , particularly for correcting a clerical error . 59 . It is now well settled that where no time-limit is specified , whatever is required to be done should be within a reasonable period . In Collector v. P. Mangamma’it was held in paragraphs 5 and 6 as follows : “ A reasonable period would depend upon the factual circumstances of the case concerned . There can not be any empirical formula to determine that question . The court/authority considering the question whether the period is reasonable or not has to take into account the surrounding circumstances and relevant factors to decide that question . In State of Gujarat v. Patel Raghav Natha ® it was observed that when even no period of limitation was prescribed , the power is to be exercised within a reasonable time and the limit of the reasonable time must be determined by the facts of the case and the nature of the order which was sought to be varied ......... _ Reasonable , being a relative term is essentially what is rational according to the dictates of reason and not excessive or immoderate on the facts and circumstances of the particular case . ” 60 . Similarly , in Joint Collector Ranga Reddy District v. D. Narsing Rao ” the exercise of revisional jurisdiction where no time-limit is specified was considered and it was held in paragraph 31 of the Report as follows : “ To sum up , delayed exercise of revisional jurisdiction is frowned upon because if actions or transactions were to remain forever open to challenge , it will mean avoidable and endless uncertainty in human affairs , which is not the policy of law . 7 ( 2003 ) 4 SCC 488 at page 491 8 ( 1969 ) 2 SCC 187 9 ( 2015 ) 3 SCC 695 C.A.
