undertaken by the Assistant Director is technically correct and the area of Survey No. 1009 is actually 687.03 acres while the recorded area is 666.25 acres ( which includes the land acquired for Manjeera Water Works Department ) . Therefore , according to the Director the variation is to the extent of 20.18 acres . The Director also expressed the opinion that the measurement error falls within the category of ‘ clerical error ’ as mentioned in the Circular dated 15 October , 1994 and necessary corrective action ought to be taken . 20 . It is not clear how the APHB learnt of the Report of the Assistant Director and its acceptance by the Director but in any event , on 10 " June , 1996 objections were raised by the APHB before the District Collector to the Report and the decision to correct the revenue records . 21 . Onreceipt of the objections , the District Collector referred the case to the Commissioner of Survey , Settlements and Land Records , Hyderabad on 1 “ August , 1996 to consider rectification of the measurement error . 22 . On 15 " September , 1997 the Commissioner directed the District Revenue Officer to take action in terms of the Circular of 15 " October , 1994 since there was a clerical error in terms of paragraph 5 of the Circular . However , the Commissioner also directed that before passing any orders under Section 87 of the Act the APHB should be heard . 23 . It appears that the APHB was thereafter heard by the District C.A. Nos . / 2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos. 21856-21862 of 2010 ) Page 9 of 31
