According to the Division Bench , there was a clerical error in the measurement area of Survey No. 1009 and therefore paragraph 5 ( d ) of the Circular dated 15 " October , 1994 was applicable and the authorities were entitled to correct the calculation error . 38 . The second ground given by the Division Bench was with reference to the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms ( Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings ) Act , 1973 . In this context , it was held that since the respondents were not holding the land , they could not have made a declaration as envisaged under the provisions of the said Act and in any event this was hardly of any relevance since Survey No. 1009 indicates that the area of that survey number was greater than 661.04 acres . However , what is of significance is the conclusion arrived at by the Division Bench that the respondents were not in possession of 11.10 acres in Survey No. 1009 . Possession of the entire Survey No. 1009 was with the APHB . Discussion 39 .
