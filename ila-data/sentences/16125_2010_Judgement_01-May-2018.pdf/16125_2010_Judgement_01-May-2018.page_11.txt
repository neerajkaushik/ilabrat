26 . It appears that in spite of the status quo order passed by the Commissioner ( Appeals ) the revenue records were corrected by issuing a Supplementary Sethwar . Be that as it may , the respondents challenged the ex parte order dated 24 " March , 1999 by filing a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court on 5 " April , 1999 . The writ petition was numbered as the W.P. No. 7940 of 1999 . Among the grounds taken by the respondents , in the writ petition , was that the appeal filed by the APBH was beyond time and an ex parte order ought not to have been passed by the Commissioner ( Appeals ) . 27 . On 10 " August , 2000 the learned Single Judge hearing the writ petition passed an interim order to earmark the land in possession of the APHB and whether it is occupying 661.04 acres or more . In compliance with the interim order , the Assistant Director gave a Report dated 23 " June , 2001 to the effect that the area of Survey No. 1009 is 666.25 acres including 5.21 acres with Manjeera Water Works Department . It is important to note that the Assistant Director did not report that the area of Survey No. 1009 was more than 666.25 acres . In other words , there was a turn-around from the earlier decisions taken in this regard . It was reported as follows : â€œ After fixing the boundaries as stated above the land available within such boundaries surveyed with the help of theodolite ( traverse survey ) and arrived the total area as Ac .666.25 gts . which is tallied with the recorded area of survey no. 1009 as per survey records . The survey work is concluded on 11.6.2001 . C.A. Nos . / 2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos. 21856-21862 of 2010 ) Page 11 of 31
