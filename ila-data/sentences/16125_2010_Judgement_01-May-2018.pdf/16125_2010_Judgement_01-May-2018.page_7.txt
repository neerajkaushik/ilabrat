15 . It is also significant to note that while the respondents had been contending that there was an excess of 11.10 acres that had not been acquired , the Assistant Director came to the conclusion that 20.18 acres had not been acquired . 16 . At this stage , we may take a slight diversion and refer to a Circular dated 15 " October , 1994 issued by the Commissioner of Survey , Settlements and Land Records . This Circular concerns itself with Section 87 of the Act it seeks to explain a ‘ clerical error ’ that could be rectified . 17 . The relevant portions of the Circular dated 15 " October , 1994 are paragraphs 4 and 5 and they read as follows : “ Clarification : There is no time limit for entertaining clerical errors , and District : Revenue Officer is competent to entertain clerical errors . The time limit is prescribed only for errors other than clerical errors . For rectification of errors other than clerical errors condonation of delay is required , for which District : Revenue Officer alone is competent . However the District : Revenue Officer is not competent to carryout correction other than clerical errors without the approval of the Commissioner , Survey , Settlement and Land Records . Clarification : Section 87 of the Land Revenue Act 1317 Fasli does not provide definition of clerical errors and errors other than clerical errors . The clerical errors are minor errors which do not involve alteration in area , change of classification , or change of name of the pattedar . A few examples of errors , which come under the category of clerical errors , are furnished below : Name of the Pattedar misspelt . Inter-change of survey numbers . Survey no . missing in the survey map . Area is calculated wrongly though measurement on ground and records support the correct area . Boge C.A.
