been acquired by the APHB in 1968 it is not understandable why no follow up action taken by them . They had an option , perhaps , of proceeding against the APHB for being in wrongful possession of 11 acres and odd owned by the respondents and they certainly had the option of moving an application under Section 87 of the Act . The respondents took neither of these steps on an urgent basis or any other step that might have been available to them in law . 44 . All that the respondents did was to wait for another 25 years and then move an application under Section 87 of the Act sometime in 1993 . There was no change in the factual situation between 1968 and 1993 except construction having been made by the APHB in pursuance of its Housing Scheme . The respondents have given absolutely no explanation for filing an application under Section 87 of the Act after such an enormous lapse of time . What has been submitted is that there is no time limit for correcting a clerical error and that being so , the respondents can not be non-suited on the ground of delay and laches . 45 . We are not in agreement with the respondents on any aspect of the case . First of all we agree with the APHB that an accurate picture of the area in terms of measurement of land in Survey No. 1009 can not be fully relied upon after several decades and after construction having been made . The records had originally indicated that Survey No. 1009 consists C.A. Nos . / 2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos. 21856-21862 of 2010 ) Page 19 of 31
