interest between the defendants in the suits filed by the temple and the school . Secondly , since there was no conflict , it was not necessary to decide any conflict between the defendants in those suits in order to give relief to the temple or the school , which were the plaintiffs . On the other hand , the father of the plaintiffs and the father of the defendant were colluding in those suits filed by Temple and School . Both of them unitedly opposed those suits . In view of the same , the principles of res judicata would not apply . The Privy Council in the case of Mt. Munni vs. Tirloki Nath , AIR 1931 PC 114 has observed thus : â€œ The doctrine of res judicata finds a place in S. 11 Civil P.C. , 1908 , but it has been held by this Board on many occasions that the statement of it there is not exhaustive ; the latest recognition of this is to be found in Kalipada De v. Dwijapada Das [ AIR 1980 PC 22 ] . For the general principles upon which the doctrine should be applied it is legitimate to refer to decisions in this country : see Soorjamonee Dayee v. Suddamund Mahapatter [ I.A. Sup , Vol . 212 ] , Krishna Behari Roy v. Banwari Lal Roy [ ( 1874 ) 1 Cal . 144 ] , Raja Run Bahadur Singh v. Mt. Lachoo Koer [ ( 1885 ) 11 Cal . 301 ] . That there may be res judicata as between co-defendants has been recognized by the English Courts and by a long course of Indian decisions . The conditions under which this branch of the doctrine should be applied are thus stated by Wigram V.C. , in Cottingham v. Earl of Shrewsbury [ ( 1843 ) 3 Hare 627 ] at 638 : 16
