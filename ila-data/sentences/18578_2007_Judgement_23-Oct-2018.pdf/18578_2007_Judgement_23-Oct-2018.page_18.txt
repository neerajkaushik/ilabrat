There must be a conflict of interest between those codefendants ; ( 2 ) it must be necessary to decide the conflict in order to give the plaintiff the relief he claims ; and ( 3 ) the question between the co - defendants must have been finally decided .

A. 158 : [ AIR ( 18 ) 1931 PC 114 ] the conditions for the application of the doctrine of res judicata as between parties who have been co-defendants in a previous suit are thus laid down : there must be ( 1 ) a conflict of interest between the co-defendants , ( 2 ) the necessity to decide that conflict in order to give the plaintiff the appropriate relief , and ( 3 ) a decision of that question between the co-defendants . It may be added that the doctrine may apply even though the party , against whom it is sought to enforce it , did not in the previous suit think fit to enter an appearance and contest the question . But to this the qualification must be added that , if such a party is to be bound by a previous judgment , it must be proved clearly that he had or must be deemed to have had notice that the relevant question was in issue and would have to be decided . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 18
