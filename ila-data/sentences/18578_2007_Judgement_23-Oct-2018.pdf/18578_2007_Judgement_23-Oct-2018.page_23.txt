possession in favour of the auction purchaser . However , the subsequent documents show joint possession of the plaintiffs and the defendant . Even now the names of both the parties are found in the revenue records . The documents do not show exclusive possession of either of the parties , but would indicate that they are in joint possession . Exhibits A-7 , A-8 and A-9 are the pattas which disclose the names of both the parties in the revenue records . Even the house tax receipts are in the name of the plaintiffs ’ predecessor . ‘ A schedule ’ property has already been subjected to partition inter se among the plaintiffs after the death of Narayanswamy Mudaliar and the allotment of property in question , i.e. ‘ A Schedule ’ has been made in favour of the second plaintiff as per Exhibit A-40 . The aforementioned records and certain other material on record would negative the contention of the defendant relating to adverse possession . The plaintiffs have proved satisfactorily that they are the owners of ‘ A Schedule ’ property , i.e. , 50 % of the property partitioned in 1912 , which had ultimately fallen in the share of Mr. Narayanaswamy ( grandfather of plaintiffs ) as mentioned supra . 23
