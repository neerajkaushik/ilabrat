appeal . The defendant denied the validity of the subsequent sale deeds dated 11.9.1940 and 9.2.1950 in his written statement . Even the later partition dated 5.11.1978 was attacked as a fraudulent and collusive transaction . The defendant claimed to be in exclusive possession of the entire property from the date of the court auction , ie. , from 1933 continuously , and that he had acquired right by adverse possession . It was also pleaded by the defendant that the defendant â€™s title has already been declared twice by the Civil Court as mentioned supra and therefore , the present suit is barred by the principles of res judicata . The claim of joint possession by the plaintiffs was denied by the defendant . 3 . On a full-fledged trial , the Trial Court decreed the suit and granted the alternative relief of partition . In the first appeal filed by the defendant , the learned Single Judge reversed the judgment of the Trial Court and dismissed the suit . The Letters Patent Appeal filed by the plaintiffs was allowed by the impugned judgment and consequently the suit came to be decreed by the Division Bench of the High Court .
