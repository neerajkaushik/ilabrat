13 . Coming to the question of estoppel as argued by the defendant ’s counsel based on the admission of the father of the plaintiffs in the pleadings and in his deposition regarding the title of the father of the defendant in the aforementioned earlier litigations , it is no doubt true that an admission is the best piece of evidence . However , an admission can always be explained , unless such an admission gives rise to the principle of estoppel . The principle of estoppel could have arisen if the father of the defendant had acted to his detriment on the basis of the representation made by the plaintiffs ’ father as the basic requirement for attracting the principle of estoppel , is that the person to whom the representation has been made must have acted on the basis of such representation , and particularly to his own detriment . In the matter on hand , the father of the defendant knew about the correct position on facts and he very well knew that he was the owner to the extent of 50 % of the property only , and as he did not act to his detriment , the question of estoppel does not arise . As mentioned supra , it is well settled that in an auction purchase , the auction purchaser does not acquire any right over the property higher than that of the judgment debtor . 21
