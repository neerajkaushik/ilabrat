conflict of interest between the co-defendants and the codefendants will be bound by the decree . But if the relief given to the plaintiff does not require or involve a decision of any case between co-defendants , the co-defendants will not be bound as between each other . This Court in the case of Mahboob Sahab vs. Syed Ismail and others , ( 1995 ) 3 SCC 693 , considering the applicability of the doctrine of res judicata between co-defendants held that the following four conditions must be satisfied , namely , “ ( 1 ) there must be a conflict of interest between the defendants concerned ; ( 2 ) it must be necessary to decide the conflict in order to give the reliefs which the plaintiff claims ; ( 3 ) the question between the defendants must have been finally decided ; and ( 4 ) the co-defendants were necessary or proper parties in the former suit . ” To reach the conclusion mentioned above , this Court relied upon the judgments in the cases of Syed . Mohd . Saadat Ali Khan vs. Mirza Wiquar Ali Beg , AIR 1943 PC 115 ; Shashibushan Prasad Mishra vs. Babuji Rai , AIR 1970 SC 809 and Iftikhar Ahmed vs. Syed Meharban Ali , ( 1974 ) 2 SCC 151 . 20
