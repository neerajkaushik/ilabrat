9 . Having regard to the factual matrix we have referred to above , and having heard the learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants as well as the learned senior counsel appearing for the State , we find that the High Court has unfortunately missed a crucial point on facts . As can be seen from the extracted portion of the application dated 24.07.1999 there is a specific request for reference under Section 18 of the Act . It is not in dispute and it is borne out from the records also as seen by the High Court the compensation was received only under protest with regard to the sufficiency of the compensation . It is also seen from the communication from the Land Acquisition Officer to the appellants dated 25.09.1999 , on which date the time under Section 18 had not expired , that certified copy of the Award had not been furnished to the appellants . However , a photocopy of the Award was given , which the appellants were not inclined to acknowledge . 10 . Having regard to the fact that the appellants had accepted the compensation under protest on the point of sufficiency of the compensation and having made a specific request for reference under Section 18 on 24.07.1999 , which indisputably is within six months , we are of the view that this is a case where the request under Section 18 of the Act made on 24.07.1999 should be treated as a proper application .
