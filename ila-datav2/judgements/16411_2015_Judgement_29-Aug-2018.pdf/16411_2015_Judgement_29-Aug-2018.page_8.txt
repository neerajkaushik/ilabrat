the order impugned neither sets out the facts nor the submissions of the parties nor the findings and nor the reasons as to why the leave to file appeal is declined to the appellant . We , therefore , disapprove the casual approach of the High Court in deciding the application which , in our view , is against the law laid down by this Court in the case of State of Maharashtra vs. Sujay Mangesh Poyarekar ( supra ) . 14 ) In the light of the foregoing discussion , the impugned order deserves to be set aside . The appeal thus succeeds and is accordingly allowed and the impugned order is set aside . The case is remanded to the High Court for deciding the application made by the appellant for grant of leave to appeal afresh on merits in accordance with law keeping in view the law laid down by this Court in State of Maharashtra vs. Sujay Mangesh Poyarekar ( supra ) .
