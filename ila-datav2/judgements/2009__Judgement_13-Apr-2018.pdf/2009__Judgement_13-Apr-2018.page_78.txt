78 impugned orders of the Tribunal are liable to be set aside . After the amendment ( w.e.f . 28.02.2005 ) what is relevant is ‘ suitability of the goods for being used as Hair Oil ' for classifying the same under 33.05 . ‘ Coconut Oil ’ packed in small sachets / containers suitable for being used as ‘ Hair Oil ’ is classifiable under Chapter Tariff Item 3305 . When a good is classifiable under tariff item 3305 , by virtue of amended Section Note 2 to Section VI , no other classification is permissible . Rule 3(a ) states that the most specific description will be preferred over the more general one . In the present case , when item description is read with the Chapter Notes , Section Notes and the tests for classification that is Tariff Item 1513.19.00 and 3305.90.19 are equally specific . Hence , as per Rule 3(c ) , when goods can not be classified by reference to ( a ) or ( b ) , they shall be classified under the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit classification . Hence , the coconut oil manufactured by the respondents could rightly be classified under heading 3305.90.19 , as it occurs last in the numerical order of the tariff . By consideration of the materials placed on record and also applying the ‘ Common Parlance Test ’ , coconut oil packed in small sachets / containers understood in the market by dealers / consumers as ‘ Hair Oil ' is classifiable under Chapter 33 , tariff item 33 05 . After the amendment to Central Excise Tariff Act ( w.e.f . 28.02.2005 ) , there is material difference between the relevant Explanatory Notes in the HSN as against those provided in the Tariff Schedule to Central Excise Tariff Act , 1985 . As held in Camlin Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise , Mumbai ( 2008 ) 9 SCC 82 , when the Explanatory Notes in the HSN and the Notes tariff schedule are not aligned , reliance can not be placed upon HSN for the purpose of classification of goods .
