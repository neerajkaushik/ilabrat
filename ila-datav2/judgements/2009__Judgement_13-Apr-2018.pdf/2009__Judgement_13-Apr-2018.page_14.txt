In this regard , Shri Bagaria has also drawn the attention of the Court to Central Excise Notification No.145/56/95-CX dated 31.08.1995 whereby the following points were clarified by the CBEC in paragraphs 5 to 9 of the Circular with regard to classification of coconut oil prior to the Amendment of the Act in the Year 2005 : @ The Heading 33.05 covers “ preparations for use on the hair ” . Coconut oil is not a preparation for use on the hair . It is fixed vegetable oil capable of being used as cooking medium ( or for other purposes including for application on the hair ) . In the absence of any proof that it is specially prepared for use on the hair or any label / literature / indications on the containers to that effect , the subject goods can not be classified under heading 3305 simply because they were packed in small containers and applied by some sections of the society on the hair . ( ii ) Coconut oil , whether pure or refined and whether packed in small or large containers merits classification under Heading 1503 . ( iii ) Only if the containers bear labels / literatures etc . indicating that it is meant for application on hair as specified in Note 2 of Chapter 33 and/or if the coconut oil is used as additives or has undergone a process which make it a “ preparation for use on hair ” , that coconut oil may merit classification under Chapter 33 . 10 . It is submitted that having regard to the object behind the Amendment effected in the year 2005 , the efficacy of the above circular , though issued when Chapter No.2 of Chapter 33 ( already extracted ) was in force , would continue even in the post amendment era when Chapter No.2 has now been substituted by Note 3
