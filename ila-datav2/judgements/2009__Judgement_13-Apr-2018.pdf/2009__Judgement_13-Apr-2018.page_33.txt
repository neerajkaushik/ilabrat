33 reasonable conclusion and we are inclined to hold as such , the contention of the Revenue with regard to application of Rules 1 and 3 of the General Rules for Interpretation ; Chapter Note l1(e ) to Chapter 15 ; Note 2 to Section VI will not at all be relevant in this regard . The legislative history behind Chapter 15 ; the words and expressions in Heading 1513 of the Tariff Act ; the relevant Heading i.e. 1513 in the HSN and the conditions / requirements stipulated in Chapter Note 3 of Chapter 33 of the Central Excise Tariff read in the light of the relevant provisions of Chapter Note 3 along with the explanatory notes of Chapter 33 of the HSN , all , would lead to the irresistible conclusion that coconut oil is classifiable under Heading 1513 of Chapter 15 of the Central Excise Tariff Act . In this regard , it may be noticed that Rule 3 of the Rules of General Interpretation would apply only in a situation where the product is classifiable under two different Chapters , a position that does not exist in the present case . At the same time , Chapter Note l(e ) to Chapter 15 and Note 2 to Section VI would be applicable only if the product i.e. coconut oil would unambiguously fall under any of the Headings under Section VI , a position that can not be accepted .
