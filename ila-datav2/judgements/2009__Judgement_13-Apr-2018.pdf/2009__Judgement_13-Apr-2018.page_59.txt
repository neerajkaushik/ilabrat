59 Notes , Section Notes and the tests for classification that is Tariff Item    1513.19.00 and 3305.90.19 are equally specific . Hence , as per Rule 3(c ) ,    when goods can not be classified by reference to ( a ) or ( b ) , they shall be    classified under the heading which occurs last_in numerical order among    those which equally merit classification . Hence , the coconut_oil    manufactured by the respondents could rightly be classified under heading    3305.90.19 , as it occurs last in the numerical order of the tariff .    34 . In Union of India and Ors . v. Pesticides Manufacturing and Formulators Association of India , ( 2002 ) 8 SCC 410 , this Court has held that if there are two specific headings to which a product can be referred , the one occurring subsequently would prevail . 35 . The Tribunal set aside the demand on the ground that the " coconut oil " would merit classification under Chapter Heading 15.03 of CETA , 1985 attracting ' NIL ' rate of excise duty and not under Chapter Heading 33.05 of the CETA attracting duty of 16 % advalorem . The Tribunal erred in not appreciating that with effect from 01.03.2005 , the Central Excise Tariff Act , 1985 has undergone an amendment as per which ( Note 3 to Chapter 33 ) Heading nos.3303 to 3307 would apply , inter alia , to products whether or not mixed suitable for use as goods of these headings and put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use .
