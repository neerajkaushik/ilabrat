52 1513 19 00 -- Other ‘ Coconut Oil ’ manufactured and cleared by M / s . Moreshwar and other job workers and MAIPL can be classified either as ‘ Hair Oil ' under sub - heading 3305 or as ‘ Vegetable Oil ' under sub - heading 1513 . However , when ‘ Coconut Oil ' is put up in packing of a kind sold in retail suitable for use as application on hair would merit classification under tariff entry 33.05 . This is the object of the legislature in bringing about the amendment to Chapter Note 3 of Chapter 33 and Section Note 2 to Section VI . Chapter Note 1(e ) to Chapter 15 provides that " ..... said Chapter does not cover goods of Section VI " . This exclusion is in clear conformity and recognition of the fact that goods which otherwise would fall under Section VI are classifiable in accordance with the conditions of Chapter Notes contained in Chapter 33 ( use of goods , nature of packing , form etc . ) and under no other Heading of the Schedule . By holding that Chapter 15 covers all varieties of coconut oil , edible as well as non - edible , the Tribunal erred in not keeping in view that the object of the legislature in bringing about the amendment . 24 . As discussed earlier , the process carried on by M / s . Moreshwar and other job workers are:- ( i ) oil received from M / s .
