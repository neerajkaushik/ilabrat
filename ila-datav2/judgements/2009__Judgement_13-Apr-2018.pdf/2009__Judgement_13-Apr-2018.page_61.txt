61 product is also a test when the statute itself does not contain any definition and commercial parlance would assume importance when the goods are marketable as was held in Atul Glass Industries ( Pvt . ) Ltd. v. CCE ( 1986 ) 3 SCC 480 and Indian Aluminium Cables Ltd. v. Union of India ( 1985 ) 3 SCC 284 . In Asian Paints India Ltd. v. CCE ( 1988 ) 2 SCC 470 which was a case of emulsion paint , at para 8 it was said : ( SCC p. 473 , para 8) “ It is well settled that the commercial meaning has to be given to the expressions in tariff items . Where definition of a word has not been given , it must be construed in its popular sense . Popular sense means that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing , would attribute to it . ” " 38 . In Dabur Industries Ltd. v. Commissioner of Central Excise , Jamshedpur ( 2005 ) 4 SCC 9 , it was held that in classifying a product , the scientific or technical meaning is not to be resorted to but the test was to see what the persons using the product understand it to be . 39 . In Commissioner of Central Excise v. Wockhardt Life Sciences Limited ( 2012 ) 5 SCC 585 , this Court emphasized " Common Parlance Test " or the " Commercial Usage Test " in paras ( 33 ) to ( 37 ) and held as under : " 33 . There is no fixed test for classification of a taxable commodity . This is probably the reason why the “ common parlance test ” or the “ commercial usage test ” are the most common ( see A. Nagaraju Bros. v. State of A.P. 1994 Supp ( 3 ) SCC 122 ) . Whether a particular article will fall within a particular tariff heading or not has to be decided on the basis of the tangible material or evidence to determine how such an article is understood in “ common parlance ” or in “ commercial world ” or in “ trade circle ” or in its popular sense meaning . It is they who are concerned with it and it is the sense in which they understand it that constitutes the definitive index of the legislative intention , when the statute was enacted ( see Delhi Cloth and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. State of Rajasthan ( 1980 ) 4 SCC 71 ) . 34 . One of the essential factors for determining whether a product falls within Chapter 30 or not is whether the product is understood as a pharmaceutical product in common parlance [ see CCE v. Shree Baidyanath Ayurved Bhavan Ltd. ( 2009 ) 12 SCC 419 and CCE v. Ishaan Research Lab ( P ) Ltd. ( 2008 ) 13 SCC 349 ] . Further , the quantity of medicament used in a particular product will also not be a relevant factor for , normally , the extent of use of medicinal ingredients is very low because a larger use may be harmful for the human body . [ Puma Ayurvedic Herbal ( P ) Ltd. v. CCE ( 2006 ) 3 SCC 266 , State of Goa v. Colfax Laboratories Ltd. ( 2004 ) 9 SCC 83 and B.P.L. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. CCE 1995 Supp ( 3 ) SCC 1 . ]
