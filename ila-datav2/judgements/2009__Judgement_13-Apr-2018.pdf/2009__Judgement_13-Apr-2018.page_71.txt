71 General Explanation to the said HSN Notes places certain conditions , i.e. : ( a ) [ when the goods are ] In packings of a kind sold to the consumer and put up with labels , literature or indications that they are for use as perfumery , cosmetic or toilet preparations , or as room deodorizers ; or ( b ) Put up in a form clearly specialized to such use ( e.g. nail varnish put up in small bottles furnished with the brush required for applying the varnish ) . It is important to note that the pre - amended Schedule ( prior to CETA amendment ) also had the same rigours as HSN Notes such as " the product requiring labels and literatures including the specialized use " ( as Chapter Note 2 to Chapter 33 ) . However , after the amendment with effect from 28.02.2005 , the Parliament consciously chose not to impose or place the same rigours for classification of goods under this Heading and deleted the same . The Parliament intentionally and consciously deleted these conditions in the new ( renumbered ) Chapter Note 3 to Chapter 33 of the Tariff Schedule to the CETA . Therefore , to apply these conditions , postamendment would be against the intent of the Parliament . Hence , HSN Chapter Note can not be relied upon to determine the classification rather the CETA Tariff Chapter Note must be considered . 57 .
