Union of India ( 1985 ) 3 SCC 284 has culled out this principle in the following words : ( SCC p. 291 , para 13 ) “ 13 . To sum up the true position , the process of manufacture of a product and the end use to which it is put , can not necessarily be determinative of the classification of that product under a fiscal schedule like the Central Excise Tariff . What is more important is whether the broad description of the article fits in with the expression used in the Tariff . ”    36 . Moreover , the functional utility and predominant or primary usage of the commodity which is being classified must be taken into account , apart from the understanding in common parlance . [ See O.K. Play ( India ) Ltd. v. CCE ( 2005 ) 2 SCC 460 , Alpine Industries v. CCE ( 2003 ) 3 SCC 111 , Sujanil Chemo Industries v. CCE & Customs ( 2005 ) 4 SCC 189 , ICPA Health Products ( P ) Ltd. v. CCE ( 2004 ) 4 SCC 481 , Puma Ayurvedic Herbal ( 2006 ) 3 SCC 266 , Ishaan Research Lab ( P ) Ltd. ( 2008 ) 13 SCC 349 and CCE v. Uni Products India Ltd. ( 2009 ) 9 SCC 295 ] 37 .

In Commissioner of Central Excise , Delhi v. Carrier Aircon Ltd. ( 2006 ) 5 SCC 596 , this Court held as under : " 14 . End use to which the product is put to by itself can not be determinative of the classification of the product . See Indian Aluminium Cables Ltd. v. Union of India ( 1985 ) 3 SCC 284 . There are a number of factors which have to be taken into consideration for determining the classification of a product . For the purposes of classification the relevant factors inter alia are statutory fiscal entry , the basic character , function and use of the goods . When a commodity falls within a tariff entry by virtue of the purpose for which it is put to ( produced ) , the end use to which the product is put to , can not determine the classification of that product .
