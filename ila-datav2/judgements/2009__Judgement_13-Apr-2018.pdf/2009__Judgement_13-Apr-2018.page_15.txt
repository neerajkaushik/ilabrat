( Chapter 33 ) . 11 . An order dated 03.06.2009 of the Central Board of Excise and Customs ( CBEC ) under Section 37B of the Central Excise Act has been placed before us . The said order is to the effect that if coconut oil is packed in containers upto 200 ml it may be considered generally for use as hair oil . If , however , the same coconut oil is packed in one litre or two litres pack , classification would be under Chapter 15 as coconut oil . It has been urged by Shri Bagaria that the learned Appellate Tribunal in Rajasthan Oil Mills Vs . Commissioner of Central Excise ! had taken the view that repacking of coconut oil from bulk containers in retail pack of 200 ml or less would not make the item classifiable under Chapter 33 . It is submitted that the Revenue â€™s Appeal against the aforesaid order of the learned Tribunal i.e. Civil appeal Nos.2023 - 2037 of 2014 has been dismissed by this Court by Order dated 07 - 12 - 2014 following which the CBEC has issued another circular bearing no.1007/14/2015 CX dated 12 - 10 - 2015 withdrawing the earlier Circular 12014 ( 314 ) ELT 541 ( Tribunal )
