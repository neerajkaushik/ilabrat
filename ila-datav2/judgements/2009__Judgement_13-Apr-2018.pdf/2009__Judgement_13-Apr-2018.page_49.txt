49 The very nature of packing shows that the product is meant to facilitate such use as ‘ Hair Oil ' and the same is classifiable under Chapter 33 . It is alleged that with an intention to evade payment of duty , M / s . MAIPL have mis - declared the excisable coconut oil ( un - perfumed Hair Oil ) as ‘ edible grade / oil ' filtered 100 % pure coconut oil . 20 . Findings of the Tribunal:- The tribunal set aside the order of the Commissioner by holding that Chapter 15 covers all varieties of coconut oil , edible as well as non - edible and it is not essential that the edible coconut oil should be marketed in packaging approved by PFA Rules for classifying it under Chapter 15 and that the earlier decision of the Tribunal ( prior to amendment ) applies to the corresponding entries even after amendment . In the case of MAIPL , after referring to earlier decisions of the Tribunal , CESTAT held as under : " ... The packing of coconut oil in that case was not of the type referred to , above or which could be solely and exclusively said to be meant for application on hair only . As such the Tribunal held that Chapter 2 to Chapter 33 was not applicable for classifying the goods in that case under Chapter 33 . HSN Explanatory Notes to Chapter 33 were same before and after 28.02.05 . Moreover entries under Chapter 15 relating to coconut oil in the HSN and Central Excise Tariff after 28.02.2005 are also identical . Therefore , the decision of the Tribunal in the above case interpreting the scope of Chapter 15.13 and 33.05 of Central Excise Tariff applies to the corresponding entries even after 28.02.2005 . The above ratio of the decision of the Tribunal therefore squarely applies to the present case also ... " 21 . Contention of the Revenue:- Learned Senior Counsel Mr. A.K. Panda submitted that the tribunal failed to consider that by virtue of amendment to Central Excise Tariff Act , 1985 with effect from 28.02.2005 , ‘ Hair Oil ’ other than perfumed ones merit classification under tariff item No.3305.90.19 .
