18 be applicable in determining the classification of the product in question is the first question that may be dealt in view of the very emphatic arguments made on behalf of the Revenue on this question . 14 . Shri A.K. Panda , learned Senior Counsel for the Revenue has urged that a detailed market survey undertaken by the Revenue indicated that the consumers who purchase “ coconut oil ” in small containers invariably make the said purchase for use as hair oil and not as edible oil . It has , therefore , been urged by Shri Panda that the product in dispute in the present case i.e. “ coconut oil ” in small packings should be classified under Heading 3305 and not under Heading 1513 . To support the contention advanced Shri Panda has referred to several pronouncements of this Court wherein it has been held that the object of classification of goods for the purpose of Central Excise and other Fiscal Legislation is to raise the revenue and , therefore , scientific and technical meaning must be avoided and the particular product as understood in trade and in common parlance should be preferred .
