Whether Coconut Oil falls under Chapter 15 and applicability of Interpretative Rule 3:- Contention of the assessee is that the description of ‘ Coconut Oil ' under Chapter 15 is specific and hence applicable to the subject goods in terms of Rule 3(a ) of the Interpretative Rules . It is wellsettled that Rule 3(a ) of " General Rules for the Interpretation " is invokable only if the Headings and the relevant Sections and the Chapter Notes are not clearly determinative of the classification . Claim of the assessee is that the description ‘ Coconut Oil ' under Chapter 15 is specific and hence , applicable to their goods in terms of Rule 3(a ) of the Interpretative Rules , though appears attractive , the same does not merit acceptance . This is because the classification of the impugned goods is based on the terms of Headings , relative Chapter Notes and Section Notes which are paramount in this regard under the primary and main Rule 1 of the Interpretative Rules .
