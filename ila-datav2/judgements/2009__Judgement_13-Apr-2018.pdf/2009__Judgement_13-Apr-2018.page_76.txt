76 of the said Circular reads as under : 64 . 541 ( Tri . - Mumbai ) , it was held that repacking of ‘ Edible Grade Coconut Oil ’ from bulk pack to retail pack of 200 ml and less are not classifiable under Chapter 33 of Central Excise Tariff which covers " cosmetic or toilet preparations " rather it would be classifiable under Chapter 15 which covers " animal or vegetable fats and oils and their cleavage products " . Challenging the judgment of the Tribunal in Raj Mills Ltd. case , the appeals preferred by the Revenue in CA Nos . 2023 - 37 of 2014 were dismissed on ee Hence , in view of the amendments / insertion of Chapter Note and Section Note , the classification of coconut oil would depend upon the fact as to how the majority of the customers use the said product . Therefore , if coconut oil is packed in packages which are generally meant for sale in retail as hair oil , in that case , the said product would be classified as hair oil under heading 3305 , even though few consumers may use it as edible oil . Through field survey , it has been gathered that smaller packs upto the sizes of 200ml are normally used as hair oil by the customers . It has also been reported that in small pack sizes upto 200ml are stacked along with other hair oil care preparations / cosmetics and not in edible oil section in the retail shops . Enquiries also reveal that small packs of coconut oil displayed at the hair care shelves are used as hair oil only and the customer ask for the smaller packages or the sachets for using them as ‘ hair oil ’ . 6 . In view of foregoing discussion , it is concluded that coconut oil packed in containers upto 200ml may be considered as generally used as hair oil . This would bring uniformity in assessment in respect of coconut oil sold in small containers irrespective of the fact as to whether its use as hair oil is indicated on containers / labels or not . Therefore , following instructions / directions are issued : ( i ) Circular No . 145/56/95-CX dated 31.08.1995 stands withdrawn . ( ii ) the coconut oil packed in small container of sizes upto 200ml shall be classified under heading 3305 . " In Raj Oil Mills Ltd. v.
