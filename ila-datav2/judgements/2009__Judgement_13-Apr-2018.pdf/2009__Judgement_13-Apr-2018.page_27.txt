Chapter Note 3 of Chapter 33 makes it clear that Heading 3305 , inter alia , would apply to products “ which are suitable for use as goods mentioned in the Heading and if they are put up in packings of a kind sold by retail for such use ” . Heading 3305 deals with “ preparations for use on the hair ” . In the present case , it is not in dispute that in the packings of coconut oil the inscription “ edible oil ” is mentioned . There is no representation , declaration or advertisement in the packings that the same can be or is meant to be used as a hair oil . 28 .
