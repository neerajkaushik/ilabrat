9 ) Before we answer this question , it would be necessary to take note of those amendments in the Central Law , i.e. , MV Act from time to time which have bearing on these cases . 10 ) Section 2(8 ) of the MV Act ( the Central Act ) provides the definition of ‘ dealer ’ . As per this provision , as originally stood , a manufacturer was also included in the definition of ‘ dealer ’ . However , this provision was amended vide Act 54 of 1994 whereby the Legislature omitted ‘ manufacturer ’ from the ambit of the expression ‘ dealer ’ . The manufacturer , therefore , no more remained the dealer . The amended definition of ‘ dealer ’ which came into effect with effect from November 14 , 1994 , is as under : " 2 . Definitions.—In this Act , unless the context otherwise requires , — ( 8) “ dealer ” includes a person who is engaged — ( a ) [ * * * ] ( d ) in building bodies for attachment to chassis ; or ( c ) in the repair of motor vehicles ; or ( d ) in the business of hypothecation , leasing or hire - purchase of motor vehicle ; ” 11 ) Thus , under the Central Act , prior to its amendment in November , 1994 , motor vehicles would require registration in all events , save and except those which were in possession of “ dealers ” . In the latter event , the vehicles could be temporarily kept under a trade certificate , which , under the rules , provides extremely limited mobility . In November , 1994 , manufacturers were taken out of this exception by amendment in the definition of dealers .
