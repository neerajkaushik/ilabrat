As would be noticed , tax under Section 5 of the Bihar Act is paid by the ultimate buyers who , on purchase of vehicles and becoming owners thereof , get these vehicles registered in their names . After the manufacture of the vehicle and before it is sold to the ultimate buyer to use the said vehicle , a temporary registration is required by the manufacturer under Section 7 of the Bihar Act . Since this registration is temporary for a limited duration , a fractional tax is paid by the manufacturer or dealer under Section 7(4 ) of the Bihar Act . Section 6 , on which the fulcrum of dispute revolves , deals with those vehicles which are in possession of a manufacturer or dealer in the course of his business and are held under trade certificates . Sections 5 , 6 and 7 are reproduced below in order to have an idea of the payment of these three motor vehicle taxes : " 5 .
