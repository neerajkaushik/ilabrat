8) 6 Bihar Act . Likewise , in respect of those vehicles retained and used by the appellants for their own purposes and not sold , these appellants have discharged their tax liability under Section 5 of the Bihar Act as well . In the aforesaid backdrop , the issue is as to whether such manufacturers or dealers , like the appellants herein , are liable to pay tax under Section 6 as well . To reiterate , after the manufacture of the vehicle when it remains with the manufacturer ( or when it remains with the dealer after delivery thereof to the dealer by the manufacturer ) and before it is sold to the ultimate consumer , the vehicle is brought on the road and is driven . It maybe for the purpose of testing the technical suitability of such a vehicle or when it goes for delivery from the manufacturer ’s factory to the dealer ’s showroom . Likewise , dealer may also drive this vehicle for limited purpose , say it is driven by the customer etc . Since , a vehicle can not be brought on road and be driven without any valid registration , MV Act contemplates two situations to meet such contingencies . It provides for temporary registration under Section 43 of the MV Act . Another option is given to those manufacturers or dealers who obtain trade certificates from the registering authority and in such a case as per Rule 33 of the Motor Vehicle Rules , manufacturers or dealers are exempted from the necessity of registration . The appellants in these appeals are either manufacturers or dealers . They have paid taxes under Section 7(4 ) of the Bihar Act . In respect of such vehicles , taxes also stand paid under Section 5 of the Bihar Act . Question of additional tax liability under Section 6 of the Act arises in this backdrop .
