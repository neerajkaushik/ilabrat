31 ) In view of the aforesaid specific legal provisions , judgment in the case of Hindustan Steel Ltd. referred to by the appellants will not be applicable in the instant case . It is also to be borne in mind that while upholding the validity of Section 23 of the Act in Telco , insofar as penalty is concerned , the Court had set aside the same on the ground that before imposing the penalty , no show cause notice was issued . Permission was given to the tax authorities to take fresh decision after giving the show cause notice . It is an admitted case that show cause notices were issued and after hearing the appellants , the penalty was imposed . Taking into consideration all these aspects , the High Court in the impugned judgment dated July 22 , 2003 in the case of M / s . R.K. Automotives & Ors . ( Civil Appeal Nos . 8 - 12 of 2004 ) has repelled the challenge against imposition of penalty . We agree with the aforesaid conclusion . 32 ) As a result , all these appeals are dismissed . scoes swe J. ( A.K. SIKRI ) sumeeeveeeeeaneeurereenrreweeermenreesoTE J. ( M.R.
