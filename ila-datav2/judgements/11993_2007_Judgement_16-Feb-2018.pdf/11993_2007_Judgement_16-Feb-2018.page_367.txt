367 considered at all . The evidence of Tamil Nadu â€™s Witness No . 1 should have been the sole criteria for allocation of water for the Cauvery Mettur project . Thus , the Tribunal should have allocated not more than 41.89 TMC of water to Tamil Nadu for the said project and not 54.68 TMC as done in the final order . 319 . Finally , he submitted that the Tribunal had failed to recognize that the area of irrigation requiring water allocation , as submitted by Tamil Nadu , was covered by two irrigation projects / systems in Tamil Nadu and had awarded an excess amount of 9.51 TMC in that regard . This " double accounting " of irrigable areas was erroneous and the water allocated to Tamil Nadu had to be proportionately reduced . Tamil Nadu 's witness , A. Mohanakrishnan , had himself admitted that the existing second crop area was 70,000 acres whereas the Tribunal considered the area to be 87,500 acres . Similar admissions had been made with respect to other areas in Tamil Nadu . Thus , the water allocated by the Tribunal was far in excess of the water required by such areas for irrigation .
