( xv ) ( xvi ) 462 beneath the surface in Tamil Nadu which the Tribunal has not taken into account citing it as a conjecture . We , while keeping in mind the risks associated with over extraction of underground water , deem it fit that 10 TMC of the said available groundwater in Tamil Nadu can , in the facts and circumstances of the present case , be accounted for in the final determination of its share . The Tribunal had drastically reduced the share of Karnataka towards Domestic and Industrial purpose for the reason being that only 1/3"4 of the city of Bangaluru falls within the river basin and also on the presumption that 50 % of the drinking water requirement would be met from ground water supply . The said view taken by the Tribunal ignores the basic principle pertaining to drinking water and is , thus unsustainable . Keeping in mind the global status that the city has attained , an addition of 4.75 TMC is awarded to Karnataka . The perspective of the Tribunal to assign 10 TMC of water for environmental protection does not require to be revisited , for such a revisit may result in unwarranted pollution and defeat the conception of sustained environmental purity .
