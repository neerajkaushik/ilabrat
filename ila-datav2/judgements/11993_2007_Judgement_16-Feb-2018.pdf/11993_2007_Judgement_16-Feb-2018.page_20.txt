20 “ We would like to clarify one aspect . The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the State of Karnataka as well as the State of Tamil Nadu have commended us to various authorities which we have already referred to in the context of Article 136 of the Constitution , but the purpose behind the said delineation is to show the broad canvas of the aforesaid constitutional provision in the context of maintainability of the civil appeals . How the final order passed by the Tribunal would be adjudged within the parameters of the said constitutional provision has to be debated when we finally address the controversy pertaining to the subject - matter of the civil appeals . ” 19 . Referring to para 82 of the judgment , it is submitted by Mr. Nariman , learned senior counsel for the State of Karnataka , that this Court should exercise the wide powers bestowed in it under Article 136 of the Constitution in a case of this nature and exercise its discretion . Similar was the submission of learned senior counsel appearing for the other States . Be it clarified that each one is a contesting appellant as also respondent . 20 . Keeping in view the controversy at hand , we think it appropriate to advert to the other legal issues and appreciate the factual score on the required parameters which will be unfolded in the course of our deliberations . We do not presently intend to state it as wide or broad approach or restricted or narrow approach . The said concept shall be dwelled upon at the relevant stage .
