225 Committee also reflected over the different projects in different States , land use , cultivated areas and agricultural practices , geology and minerals as well as the climate , rainfall and water resources vis - a - vis the competing States . Gauge and discharge observations at the recorded sites in Tamil Nadu and Mysore in particular were noted too . In view of the long term record available for the main Cauvery at Krishna Raja Sagara , Mettur and Grand Anicut / Lower Anicut , the Committee estimated the yield at 50 % , 75 % and 90 % dependabilities . The Committee , thus assigned sufficient weightage to the existence of Krishna Raja Sagara and Mettur reservoirs and , accordingly , relied upon the data from 1933 - 34 when both these reservoirs were in position . The yield at the terminal point of the basin , namely , Lower Coleroon Anicut , was , thus , assessed by the Committee at 740 TMC at 50 % dependability , 670 TMC at 75 % dependability and 623 TMC at 90 % dependability . The Tribunal observed that the report of the Committee had been considered by the Chief Ministers of the States whereupon they concurred with the finding of the total yield within the Cauvery basin .
