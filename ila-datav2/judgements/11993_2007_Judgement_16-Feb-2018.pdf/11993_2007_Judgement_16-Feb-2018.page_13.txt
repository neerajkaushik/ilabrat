13 The deponent had further submitted that modification was required having regard to the ground realities , needs and requirements as stated in the application . 11 . The Court , after perusal of the said affidavit and the annexed application for modification , noted that the application contained certain averments which can not be conceived of to be filed in a court of law seeking modification of an earlier order . The Court categorically stated that agitation in spontaneity or propelled by some motivation or galvanized by any kind of catalystic component can never form the foundation for seeking modification of an order . The Court observed that its order was bound to be complied with by all concerned and it is the obligation of the executive to maintain law and order and to see that the Court â€™s order is complied with in letter and spirit . The Court further observed that citizens can not become law unto themselves ; and when a court of law passes an order , it is the sacred duty of the citizens to obey the same . The Court also expressed anguish over the pleadings in the application and also the affidavit filed for urgency and deplored the same .
