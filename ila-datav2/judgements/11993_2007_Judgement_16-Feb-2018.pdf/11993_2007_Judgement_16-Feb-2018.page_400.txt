He has apprised us that awards were passed by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal , Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal and Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal and a scheme for implementation of award was framed when required and only in the case of Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal and no scheme was framed in respect of awards passed by the other Tribunals . According to him , framing of a scheme is not mandatory and the Central Government being alive to its role shall do the needful at the relevant time . It is further argued that it is the mandate of the 1956 Act that the scheme framed under Section 6A is to be by laying before both Houses of the Parliament and , hence , it has to be treated as a legislative policy and , therefore , the Court , in such a situation , should not issue any direction .
