215 developments made in the different State vis - a - vis the share of each riparian State . P. The findings of the Tribunal on various issues    P.1 Prescriptive rights and other claims    182 . Vis - a - vis the prescriptive rights and other claims projected by the States , the Tribunal reiterated that the Agreement of 1924 along with the rules of regulation of Krishna Raja Sagara reservoir , as appended thereto , did not indicate anything to that effect and neither any reference had been made to the areas over which any prescriptive right had been acquired prior thereto or existing nor any provision had been made with regard thereto . It differentiated in this respect the Agreement of 1892 which laid stress in respect of prescriptive rights already acquired and then existing from the Agreement of 1924 which did not contain a reference to any existing prescriptive right of the State of Madras or its cultivators in respect of the water to be released to it . The Tribunal perceived that the Government of Mysore and the State of Madras while entering into the Agreement of 1924 seemed to have recognized the total areas under irrigation of the Cauvery System within the State of Mysore
