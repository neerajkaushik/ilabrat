293 that both the States had furnished their crop water requirement including effective rainfall in respect of their projects in consultation with the experts . 244 . On the aspect of system efficiency , the Tribunal registered that both these States as per the information furnished by them claimed that they had worked out their crop water requirement as was optimally required for different crops . Referring to the report of the National Commission on Agriculture , 1976 , the Tribunal observed that in water short areas , giving fewer than optimum number of waterings to a large crop area at appropriate stages of crop growth would result in greater overall agricultural production and , therefore , planning projects with optimum Delta ( water depth ) would result in higher water demand and may not be necessary in water paucity areas compared to an irrigation system catering for fewer waterings which may cover larger areas and secure greater overall production . The Tribunal was , thus , of the view that the party - States should improve their crop water management practices which enfold several parameters involved in achieving the desired results . It suggested that both the States should improve the system efficiency to 65 % in the existing projects which was possible
