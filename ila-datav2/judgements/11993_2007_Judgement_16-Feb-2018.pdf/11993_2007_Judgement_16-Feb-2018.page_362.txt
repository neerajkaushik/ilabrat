He then submitted that the Tribunal had completely overlooked the water requirements for the city of Bengaluru in its final order . Bengaluru being a metropolis with a burgeoning population ought to have been treated as sui generis and been given special dispensation while water was being allocated . Water supply for Bengaluru was entirely sourced from the Cauvery river but its use could not be treated as a trans - basin diversion as erroneously claimed by Tamil Nadu which itself was responsible for trans - basin diversion of water to irrigate an area of 3.29 lakh acres within its territory . The Tribunal allocated a miniscule amount of 1.85 TMC to Karnataka under the head " domestic and industrial water requirement projected for 2011 " while arriving at 20 % consumptive use for domestic purposes and 2.5 % for industrial purposes . He did not challenge the percentage of consumptive use ; rather he contended that the Tribunal had not considered the actual water requirements for the city of Bengaluru .
