Dealing with the issues on the 1886 lease agreement , the Court posed the question — whether it is an existing contract under the 1935 Act . Reference was made to Section 177 of the 1935 Act and interpreting the same , the Court held : “ 41 . Section 177 of the 1935 Act , omitting the unnecessary part reads , “ 177 . ( 1 ) ... any contract made before the commencement of Part III of this Act by , or on behalf of , the Secretary of State - in - Council shall , as from that date — ( a ) if it was made for the purposes which will after the commencement of Part III of this Act be purposes of the Government of a Province , have effect as if it had been made on behalf of that Province .... ” By virtue of this provision , the existing contracts of the Secretary of State - in - Council would have the effect as if they had been made on behalf of the Province . When we see the 1886 Lease Agreement in the light of Section 177 of the 1935 Act , there remains no doubt at all that lease that was executed by the Secretary of State - inCouncil for the Presidency of Madras ( Madras Province )
