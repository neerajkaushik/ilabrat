180 According to him , the foundation of the complaint is the 1892 and 1924 Agreements and once they are treated to have expired , in the absence of any other aspect being stated in the complaint , it does not call for an adjudication by the Tribunal despite the matter having been referred to the Tribunal for adjudication . To bolster the said stand , he has relied upon the language employed in Section 3 of the 1956 Act . Section 3 of the 1956 Act reads as follows : “ 3 . Complaints by State Governments as to water disputes.—If it appears to the Government of any State that a water dispute with the Government of another State has arisen or is likely to arise by reason of the fact that the interests of the State , or of any of the inhabitants thereof , in the waters of an inter - State river or river valley have been , or are likely to be , affected prejudicially by — ( a ) any executive action or legislation taken or passed , or proposed to be taken or passed , by the other State ; or ( b ) the failure of the other State or any authority therein to exercise any of their powers with respect to the use , distribution or control of such waters ; or ( c ) the failure of the other State to implement the terms of any agreement relating to the use , distribution or control of such waters , the State Government may , in such form and manner as may be prescribed , request the Central Government to refer the water dispute to a Tribunal for adjudication . ”
