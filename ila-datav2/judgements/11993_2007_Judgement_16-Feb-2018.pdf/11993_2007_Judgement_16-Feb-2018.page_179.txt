179 continued solely because of the experience gathered would not be appropriate and it would be contrary to the concept of understanding the clauses in a contract to give effect to its continuance . The continuance after 50 years was dependent on certain aspects and , therefore , we have no hesitation in holding that the agreement expired after 50 years . The submission on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu is that the obligations of the contract continued but , in this context , it is worth noting that the parties to the agreement had entered into correspondence with the Central Government agitating their grievances and they met at the various levels to discuss and to arrive at an acceptable arrangement . That not having been accepted , the complaint was lodged . Taking into consideration the entire conspectus of facts and circumstances , we hold that the agreement expired after 50 years in the year 1974 . M. Did the complaint not require any adjudication ?    148 . It is submitted by Mr. Nariman that the manner in which the complaint had been lodged and a request had been made for referring the dispute that had arisen between the States of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu was not statutorily entertainable .
