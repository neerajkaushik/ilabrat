( vii ) ( viii ) 460 complaint of the State of Tamil Nadu did not warrant any adjudication , does not commend any acceptation . This Court in In Re : Presidential Reference ( Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal ) has held that waters of an inter - state river passing through corridors of the riparian states constitute a national asset and no single State can claim exclusive ownership of its water . In this context , the principle of equitable apportionment internationally recognized by the Helsinki Rules , Compione Rules and Berlin Rules which have also been incorporated in the 1987 to 2002 National Water Policies , have been regarded to be the guiding factor for resolving disputes qua apportionment of water of an interstate river . After considering all relevant materials brought on record , we are of the view that having regard to imperative of economy of consumption of water , the final determination of irrigated area arrived at by the Tribunal for Tamil Nadu , can not be declared incorrect or fallacious .
