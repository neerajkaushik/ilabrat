216 as well as the State of Madras irrespective of any prescriptive right having been acquired by the State of Madras on any part or whole of the areas under irrigation and it rather provided for future extension of irrigation in new areas on the terms and conditions as set out . Referring to a letter dated 06.07.1915 addressed by the then Dewan of Mysore to the Resident of Mysore which carried , according to the Tribunal , an admission on behalf of the State of Mysore to the effect that at that point of time , the area irrigated under the Cauvery System in Madras was 12,25,500/- acres , it upheld the claim of State of Tamil Nadu that prior to the execution of the Agreement of 1924 , its area of irrigation was 13,26,233 acres . The Tribunal , thus , concluded that in the overall background , it would be futile to examine as to what was the total area in the then State of Madras over which prescriptive rights had been acquired or were in existence for the purpose of allocating the quantity of water to the State of Tamil Nadu and that for all intents and purposes , the issue regarding prescriptive right of Madras had been rendered academic .
