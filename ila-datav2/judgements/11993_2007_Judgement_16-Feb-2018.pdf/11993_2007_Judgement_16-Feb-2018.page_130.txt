By making provisions such as Article 363 and proviso to Article 131 , the political settlements have been taken out of the purview of judicial pronouncements . Proviso appended to Article 131 renders a dispute arising out of any treaty , agreement , covenant , engagement , sanad or similar instrument which is political in nature executed before the commencement of the Constitution and which has or has been continued in operation , non - justiciable and jurisdiction of this Court is barred . The jurisdiction of this Court is not taken away in respect of the dispute arising out of an ordinary agreement . The instruments referred to and described in the proviso are only those which are political in nature . Non - political instruments are not covered by the proviso . ”
