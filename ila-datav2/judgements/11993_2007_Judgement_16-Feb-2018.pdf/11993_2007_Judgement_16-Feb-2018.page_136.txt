136 108 . A passage from John Westlake International Law : Part - I. Peace , Cambridge University Press , 1910 has been commended to us . The said passage reads thus : " On the internal side , that is the relation of the native states to the British power , the Government of India published the following notification in its official Gazette , No . 1700 E , 21 August 1891 : " The principles of international law have no bearing upon the relations between the Government of India as representing the queen - empress on the one hand , and the native states under the suzerainty of Her Majesty on the other . The paramount supremacy of the former presupposes and implies the subordination of the latter . " And again : " Thus India is a world of itself . Not only is the action of all foreign states excluded from every part of it , but those parts which are not included in the dominions of the king - emperor are subject to a _ suzerainty , paramountcy or supremacy possessed by him , to which nothing parallel exists in the relations of states of international law " . 109 . Inspiration has also been drawn from the book Rivers in International Law ( 1959 ) by F.J. Berber , which states : " The Cauvery dispute between Mysore and Madras , settled in 1925 , was a dispute between two territories of which one was a province of British India and the other was a dependent princely state under British suzerainty .
