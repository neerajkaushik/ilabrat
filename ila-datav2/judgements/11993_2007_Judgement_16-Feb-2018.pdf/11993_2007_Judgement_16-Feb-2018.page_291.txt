As regards the percolation losses , it took note of the observation of the expert witness , Dr. I.C. Mahapatra , cited by Karnataka , that the same could be considerably reduced by proper puddling of the field . The Tribunal noted that percolation losses of water depended on the nature of the soil , climatic condition , etc . It recalled that the soil of Karnataka was mostly red soil and at places was sandy in nature in contrast to the Tamil Nadu soil which was sandy loam specially in Delta , formed with the deposit of silt over ages and was not as porous as that of Karnataka .
