303 population had been allowed 135 Its . phpd and 75 % thereof 100 Its . phpd keeping in view the different categories of cities and towns falling in the Cauvery basin . It assigned 150 Its . phpd to Bengaluru city area falling within the basin and worked out the water requirement for the urban population to be 8.70 TMC . Vis - a - vis the rural population at the rate of 70 Its . phpd , the water requirement was quantified at 8.52 TMC , thus making the total drinking water requirement to be 17.72 TMC . By assuming that 50 % of the drinking water requirement would be met from ground water , it was estimated that the component of river supply including transit losses would be 8.75 TMC . The consumptive use , i.e. , 20 % of the total for human population including livestock , was , thus calculated to be 1.75 TMC . 257 . By adopting the same norms , by and large , the domestic water requirement for the State of Tamil Nadu was computed . The total drinking water requirement for the projected population of 2011 was fixed at 21.98 TMC out of which 50 % was supposed to be met by the ground water sources and 50 % from surface water which came to 10.99 TMC . Judged by the consumptive use at the rate of 20 % , 2.20 TMC was allocated to Tamil Nadu from surface water .
