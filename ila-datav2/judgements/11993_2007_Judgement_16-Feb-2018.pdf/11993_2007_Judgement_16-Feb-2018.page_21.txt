21 C. Stand of all parties pertaining to remand of the matter to the Tribunal after deliberation of the legal issues    21 . At the commencement of the hearing of the appeals , a serious criticism was advanced on behalf of the State of Karnataka that after the hearing before the Tribunal was closed , the State of Tamil Nadu filed an affidavit which was marked as TN Ext . 1665 and when objections were raised , the Tribunal had assured that the said document would not be relied upon but unfortunately the Tribunal had referred to the contents of the affidavit and relied upon the same . Be it noted , the said affidavit came into existence because of the suo motu order passed by the Tribunal on 12.11.2002 which is as follows : â€œ During the course of hearing of arguments it transpired that most of the riparian States which are party to the proceedings cultivate paddy and allow at least 2 - 3 inches of water to remain in fields throughout till the crop matures . We are told that this is the traditional practice which is being followed : In many States in India paddy crops , after transplantation , are watered from time to time and a particular level of water need not remain in the fields throughout . It need not be pointed out that traditional practice , which is being followed in Cauvery basin states obviously will consume and require more water in the fields .
