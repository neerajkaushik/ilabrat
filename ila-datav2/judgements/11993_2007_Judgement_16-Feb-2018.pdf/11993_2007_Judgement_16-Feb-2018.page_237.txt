The Tribunal referred to the investigation undertaken by a team of experts under the United Nations Development Programme with its report stating that the total yearly quantity of replenishable groundwater that can be extracted from the shallow aquifer in the delta through high yielding medium - depth tube - wells equipped with turbine pumps is 129 TMC . It elaborated that the yearly quantity of groundwater that can be extracted by using centrifugal pumps in the Cauvery sub - basin , Vennar sub - basin and in the new delta was 33.7 TMC , 5.4 TMC and 32.5 TMC respectively . Additionally , a quantity of 56.5 TMC of groundwater per year can also be made available in the Cauvery sub - basin by lowering seasonally groundwater level to 10 meters depth below the regional groundwater level and substituting high yielding medium - depth tube - wells equipped with turbines for the low yield filter points with centrifugal pumps . This finding , however , was criticized by Tamil Nadu as impracticable and unworkable , more particularly in view of the high cost involved in purchasing the equipments suggested and in lowering the depth upto 10 meters by different cultivators in the
