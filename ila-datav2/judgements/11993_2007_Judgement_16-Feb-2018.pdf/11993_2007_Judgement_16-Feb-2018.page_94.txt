94 agreements should continue to be binding both on the States and on the successor Governments . Sir Conrad Corfield . on behalf of the Political Department contested my point of view . He referred to a meeting between himself and Lord Pethick - Lawrence at which it had been agreed that the abolition of the Crown Representative would automatically cause paramountcy to become void , together with any subsisting agreements between the Crown and the States . Sir Conrad did not agree with the view that paramountcy did not enter into the Sutiej Valley Canals Agreement of 1920 and the Jaipur and Jodhpur Salt Agreements . The first of these had been entered into on behalf of Bahawaipur by a Council of Regency controlled by the paramount power while the ruler was a minor . The Jaipur and Jodhpur Salt Agreements wee typical of those which States had been required to conclude with the paramount power during the latter half of the nineteenth century in the interests of the central revenues . The Political Adviser was unable to entertain the view that the agreements should be continued after the lapse of paramountcy . Lord Mountbatten did not take sides in this conflict of opinion . He merely forwarded both my view as well as that of the Political Department to the India Office .    It was about this time that the Secretary of State intimated that the Indian Independence Bill should include a specific denunciation of the treaties with the Indian States . Normally speaking , treaties were terminated by ‘ acts of State ’ , but there was no reason why , on an occasion of this importance and in the peculiar circumstances , this should not be done by an Act of Parliament which would emphasize the legal position whereby paramountcy did not pass to the new Indian Dominions . This was considered by the Viceroy 's advisers ; they deprecated any such formal denunciation of treaties .
