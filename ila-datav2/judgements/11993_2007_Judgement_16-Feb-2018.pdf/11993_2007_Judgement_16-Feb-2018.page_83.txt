As such a treaty previously concluded had lapsed . ” After so stating , the Tribunal distinguished the said decision Thereafter , the Tribunal has held : “ According to us the aforesaid judgment of the Supreme Court is of no help to the State of Karnataka . No other decision or provision was brought to our notice in support of the contention that the Agreement of the year 1924 ceased to exist after the Indian Independence Act 1947 came into force . The result will be that it shall be deemed that the said Agreement of 1924 survived and continued even after the coming into force of the Indian Independence Act 1947 and the Constitution of India . ” in Dr. Babu Ram Saksena ( supra ) .
