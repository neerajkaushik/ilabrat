457 framing the scheme is exclusively for implementation of the award . The authorities cited by Mr. Ranjit Kumar , we are afraid , are of no assistance in the present context . It needs no special emphasis to state that the purpose of Section 6A is to act in the manner in which the award determines the allocation and decides the dispute with regard to allocation or sharing of water . Keeping that in view , we direct that a scheme shall be framed by the Central Government within a span of six weeks from today so that the authorities under the scheme can see to it that the present decision which has modified the award passed by the Tribunal is smoothly made functional and the rights of the States as determined by us are appositely carried out . When we say so , we also categorically convey that the need based monthly release has to be respected . It is hereby made clear that no extension shall be granted for framing of the scheme on any ground . Z. The conclusions in seriatim 404 .
