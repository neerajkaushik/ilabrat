189 ( ii ) The second view is based on the stand that lower riparian State is entitled to water in its natural flow without any diminution or interference or alteration in its character . During the last century both views had been propounded — the first one by the upper riparian State and the second by the lower riparian State . If it is examined by an example , a State which is at the head of the river from which the river initially passes then such State can utilize and divert the water from the said river making the lower riparian State starve , leading to the break - down of the economy of such lower riparian State . Similarly , if the second view is pushed to its logical end , then the upper riparian State although may be in dire need of the water of such inter - State river for agriculture and other use shall be a mute spectator of the 14 water of such inter - State river flowing from its territory to the lower riparian State . ( iv ) The third view is based on the principle of “ equitable apportionment ” , that is to say that every riparian State is entitled to a fair share of the water of an inter - State river according to its need . Such a river has been provided by nature for common benefit of the community as a whole through whose territories it flows , even though those territories may be divided by political frontiers . ” 158 .
