201 Nadu reiterated its demurral that the State of Karnataka did construct four reservoirs over Kabini , Hemavathi , Harangi and Suvarnavathi tributaries of Cauvery and set up other projects for storing water of the river much beyond the limits stipulated in the agreement of the year 1924 which decisively resulted in material diminution of the supply of waters of Cauvery to its territories . According to it , such indulgences adversely affected the Ayacutdars in Tamil Nadu who had been dependent on the water of river Cauvery for centuries . While reiterating that the Agreements of 1892 and 1924 did factually recognize and protect the prescriptive rights of Tamil Nadu , a lower riparian State , over the water of Cauvery and that these agreements were the yields of deliberations over the disputes between the erstwhile Governments of Madras and Mysore , whose successors- in - interest are the present States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka , it was averred that though the State of Karnataka was at liberty to use the water of Cauvery , yet it could not do so to the prejudice of the interest of the people of Tamil Nadu . It underlined that the apportionment of the water of an interState river has to be adjudged on the principle of equitable apportionment as well as by the common law of prescriptive rights .
