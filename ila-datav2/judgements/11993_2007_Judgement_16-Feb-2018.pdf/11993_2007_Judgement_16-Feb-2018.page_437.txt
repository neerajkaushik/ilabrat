437 safe quantity to be accounted for in finally allocating / apportioning the share of Cauvery water . While expressing this view , we are not unmindful of the stand of Tamil Nadu and the aspect that overextraction of ground water in the absence of adequate replenishment and further in the areas proximate to the coastal zone is generally avoidable . However , in the attendant facts and circumstances , in view of the studied scrutiny of all pertinent facets of the issue by balancing all factors , we are of the unhesitant opinion that at least 10 TMC of ground water available in the Delta areas of Tamil Nadu can be accounted for in finally determining the apportionment of the share of the otherwise deficit Cauvery basin without touching the yield of 740 TMC . 387 . To recall , the national policies discussed above , do not , as such , debar the conjunctive use of ground water , the only caveat being periodical assessment on a scientific basis thereof and to guard against exploitation of the said resource so as not to exceed the recharging possibilities . The series of research studies made by different authorities and the range of availability of ground water as indicated by the experimental data , in our view , not only demonstrate availability of ground water in the Deltas in the State
