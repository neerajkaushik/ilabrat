138 111 . Laying emphasis on the aforesaid passages , it is argued by Mr. Nariman that the agreements are ex facie unconscionable and smack of absolute unfairness and unreasonableness because the parties were not at arm ’s length and they never did possess equal bargaining power . In Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited ( supra ) , the two - Judge Bench referred to Sections 16 , 23 and 24 of the Contract Act and quoted some relevant passages from Chitty on Contracts ( 25 t Edition , Vol . I ) . We think it appropriate to extract the said passages : “ These ideas have to a large extent lost their appeal today . ‘ Freedom of contract ’ , it has been said , ‘ is a reasonable social ideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining power between contracting parties can be assumed , and no injury is done to the economic interests of the community at large ’ . Freedom of contract is of little value when one party has no alternative between accepting a set of terms proposed by the other or doing without the goods or services offered . Many contracts entered into by public utility undertakings and others take the form of a set of terms fixed in advance by one party and not open to discussion by the other . These are called ‘ contracts d’adhesion ’ by French lawyers . Traders frequently contract , not on individually negotiated terms , but on those contained in a standard form of contract settled by a trade association . And the terms of an employee ’s contract of employment may be determined by agreement between his trade union and his employer , or by a statutory scheme of employment . Such transactions are nevertheless contracts notwithstanding that freedom of contract is to a great extent lacking .
