288 practised in Amaravathi and Lower Bhavani Project was also stressed upon . The Tribunal recalled that the principal crops raised in the Cauvery basin in Karnataka were Kharif paddy , kharif semidry , i.e. , ragi , maize etc ; rabi semi - dry , i.e. , groundnut , pulses , etc . together with perennial crops like sugarcane , mulberry , garden crops , etc . besides summer crops , i.e. , rabi / summer paddy and rabi summer semi - dry . In view of the scarcity of water , the Tribunal excluded summer paddy and summer semi - dry crops and recorded the view that it would be prudent on the part of Karnataka to go in for a paddy crop of medium duration which would give higher yield . The fact that the State Government had successfully persuaded the farmers to introduce short duration paddy variety of 120 to 130 days which resulted in saving of about 10 % water compared to the medium duration of the variety was noted . It suggested that the State Government of Karnataka should also encourage , as far as possible , replacement of the area of Kharif paddy by Ragi which is a Kharif semi - dry crop . On the basis of the said analysis , the Tribunal clearly emphasized upon the need of reduction of crop period to ensure economic and prudent use of water and also suggested modification of the crop pattern in chime therewith .
