368 T. Arguments put forth by the State of Tamil Nadu    T.1 Submissions of Mr. Shekhar Naphade : 320 . Mr. Naphade , learned senior counsel , opened the arguments on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu by taking this Court through several documents , including the National Water Policies of 1987 and 1992 , the Helsinki Rules , 1966 and the Campione Consolidation of the International Law Association Rules on International Water Resources , relevant historical aspects of the matter and the evidence on record . He also took this Court through the scope and extent of the 1956 Act and pointed out the interplay between several sections of the Act . He submitted that the term ‘ agreement ’ as mentioned in Section 2(c ) of the 1956 Act included all agreements executed prior to the coming into force of the Act and that there was no limitation on any kind of agreement under this section . Even pre-1947 agreements in relation to the use , distribution or control of inter - State waters were brought under this ambit . Thus , Karnataka 's submission that the 1892 and 1924 Agreements were not within the scope of the said Act was baseless .
