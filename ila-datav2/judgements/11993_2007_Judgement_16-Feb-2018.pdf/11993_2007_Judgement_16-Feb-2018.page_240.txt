240 many a times even causing damage to the standing paddy crop . On a scrutiny of the report of the UNDP and the Central Ground Water Board , the Tribunal concluded that as per the former , 39.2 TMC of the groundwater was available in the old Delta , whereas as per the latter , the stock was limited to 30 TMC . The Tribunal noted that this was in comparison to 28.79 TMC as estimated by Mr. Barber . It noted as well that qua the new Delta , UNDP had estimated at 32.6 TMC and Mr. Barber had estimated at 22.77 TMC . In the background of such exhaustive studies by various agencies , the Tribunal observed that in a normal year when there would be regular releases of water from Mettur , the bulk of contribution to the groundwater in the Cauvery sub - basin would be from such releases , but in any case , the contribution from surface irrigation and rainfall could not be overlooked . All these notwithstanding , the Tribunal , considering the severe limitation in the assessment of groundwater resource , made a safe estimate of 20 TMC which could be used by Tamil Nadu conjunctively with surface water . The Tribunal clarified that this quantum was arrived at after excluding the component of groundwater re - charge from river water by lateral infiltration .
