234 do create problems thereby affecting the surface flow of river Cauvery and its tributaries which in its own turn affect the storage in different reservoirs like Krishna Raja Sagara , Mettur , etc . The Tribunal underlined that it is in this background that availability of groundwater assumed importance . It also referred to the disclosures in research undertaken in the field that the availability of groundwater for use was limited to the annual re - charge which could be withdrawn and again replenished by natural rainfall / artificial modes of re - charge so much so that the annual withdrawals of groundwater in any region need to be in equilibrium with the annual replenishment of groundwater in that region . It indicated on the basis of the materials available that overwithdrawals made from an aquifer ( i.c . , water bearing rock formation ) at rates in excess of the net re - charge are described as “ mining ” of groundwater as it lowers the groundwater level permanently to the extent these over - withdrawals are made thereby leading to serious problems . It noted that if such practice of overwithdrawals would continue resulting in decline of groundwater table , the pumping of water would become more and more expensive from the greater depth thus compounding the situation .
