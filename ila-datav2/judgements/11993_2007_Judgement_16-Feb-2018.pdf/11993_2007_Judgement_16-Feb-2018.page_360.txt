360 losses . Climatic constraints justified higher water allocation to drought areas . For the same reason , Tamil Nadu 's demand for higher allocation of water was also unjustified and improper . Infact , Tamil Nadu 's cultivation of double crop was completely inconsistent with the prevailing climatic conditions in the area . Tamil Nadu 's Kuruvai crop , which would have benefitted from water provided by the North - East monsoon , was instead primarily sustained by irrigation supplies from Karnataka as it was cultivated much before the onset of the rains . The only sensible course of action would be to disallow Tamil Nadu 's Kuruvai double crop and allow only the Samba single crop . S.4 Proponements of Mr. Shyam Divan :    309 . Mr. Divan , learned senior counsel appearing for Karnataka , has stressed on the need to recognize the importance of ground water while allocating available water resources . Ground water is a renewable resource and , if not extracted regularly , would reduce the absorption capacity of the underlying aquifer resulting in rain water / surface water being wasted as run - off . Extraction of ground water is , thus , an optimal utilisation of available resources .
