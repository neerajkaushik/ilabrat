137 The dispute was not settled by the application of international law but through an authoritative decision of the sovereign power , or the British Crown . under its general responsibility to interfere in every matter in which according to its estimation the public interest was threatened with injury . That means that it was a typical case of the application of norms of municipal law . We can therefore extract nothing from it for our inquiry . Only one aspect in the dispute is significant for international law , namely , the endeavour to protect the rights of Karikal , at that time still a French possession . After representations by the French Ambassador in London the Indian Government in its Note of May 1 , 1924 , was able to state that the existing water rights of Karikal would be safeguarded . This recognition of the water rights of a neighbouring colony is in harmony with Anglo- French practice in connection with water rights in their African colonies . " 110 . We have also been referred to a passage from L. Oppenheim International Law ( 8th Edition ) which is extracted below : " 91 . The fact that the relation between the suzerain and the vassal always depends upon the special case , excludes the possibility of laying down a general rule as to the international position of vassal States . The vassal State has no relations with other States since the suzerain absorbs these relations entirety ; yet the vassal remains nevertheless a half- sovereign State on account of its internal independence . This was the position of the Indian vassal States of Great Britain , which had no international relations whatever either between themselves or with foreign States . Yet instances can be given which demonstrate that " vassal States can have some subordinate international position . "
