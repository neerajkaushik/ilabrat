236 ( 21 % ) , Tamil Nadu ( 47.2.% ) and Union Territory of Puducherry ( 61 % ) were noticed by the Tribunal . The Tribunal also took note of the fact that the development of groundwater had taken place mostly in the private sector where the owners have many a time over - exploited the available groundwater resources resulting in gradual lowering of the water level with the hazard of intrusion of sea water in the coastal areas thereby polluting the quality of groundwater in the vicinity of the coastline and , thus , rendering the groundwater in the affected area not only unfit for human consumption but also for use in agriculture . The Tribunal marked the limit of groundwater development proportionate to the annual replenishable groundwater resources as prescribed by the National Water Policy . The aspect that though underground water resources of a State had been acknowledged to be a relevant factor by the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal , Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal as well as Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal for equitable apportionment of the waters of an inter - State river system , yet they declined to investigate the question regarding availability of groundwater and quantity thereof on the ground that groundwater flow can not be accurately estimated from the technical point of view
