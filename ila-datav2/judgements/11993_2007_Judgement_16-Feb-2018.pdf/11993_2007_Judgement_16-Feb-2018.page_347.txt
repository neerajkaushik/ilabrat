He submitted that such quantum of water had been allocated after taking into account the land in Tamil Nadu which was outside the scope and purview of the 1924 Agreement . Tamil Nadu itself had consistently taken the stand that the 1924 Agreement was the law on the subject and that the parties had to be governed by the terms therein .
