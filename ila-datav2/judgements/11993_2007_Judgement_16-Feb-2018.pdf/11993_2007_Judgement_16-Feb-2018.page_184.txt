It is respectfully submitted that all areas contemplated to be irrigated under the Agreement of 1924 are concerned - — whether by Tamil Nadu or by Karnataka , they have first to be taken into account as committed uses or existing uses . The remaining areas should be considered on the principles of equitable apportionment that are well settled and on the evidence led before this Hon’ble Tribunal . ” 152 . The Tribunal , which had taken the view that the Agreements of 1892 and 1924 are valid and enforceable , alternatively suggested the apportionment of Cauvery waters on the following basis : “ ( i ) Protection of irrigated areas as existing prior to 1924 both in Karnataka as well as Tamil Nadu . ( ii ) The development of irrigation as contemplated in the 1924 agreement but actually developed before 1974 . ( iii ) All other development to be considered as per different priorities suggested by them , indicated later on in the report . ” 153 .
