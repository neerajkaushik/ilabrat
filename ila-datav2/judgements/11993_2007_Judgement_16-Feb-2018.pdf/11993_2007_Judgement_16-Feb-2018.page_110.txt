110 Article 363 and in case of agreement relating to sharing of water of inter - State river , the Tribunal has to examine the claims of the different riparian States in the background of such agreement and , therefore , the enquiry is not barred under Article 363 of the Constitution . Attacking the said findings , it is canvassed by Mr. Nariman that the Tribunal has failed to appreciate the fact that Articles 262 and 263 operate in entirely different fields , for Article 262 is only an exception how a particular matter relating to interState river water disputes between States of India have to be decided because it is not decided by the exclusive remedy provided in Article 131 of the Constitution but by an alternative mode now prescribed by the Parliament by law under Article 261(2 ) , that is , the 1956 Act . It is further put forth by him that the agreements of the present nature come within the purview of Article 363 and to substantiate the said argument , he has placed reliance on State of Seraikella v. Union of India and another â€™ . 87 . It is submitted by Mr. Dwivedi , learned senior counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu , that the bar of jurisdiction of this Court under Article 363 of the Constitution relates only to certain clauses of 91951 SCR 474 : AIR 1951 SC 253
