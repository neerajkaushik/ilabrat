151 Singh & Ors . ? ! , Ranjan Sinha v. Ajay Kumar Vishwakarma ’ ’ , State of M.P. v. Bhopal Sugar Industries Ltd. ” ° are applicable . 123 . In Balbir Singh ( supra ) , the erstwhile State of Punjab was reorganized by the Punjab Reorganisation Act , 1966 and on the appointed date , i.e. , November 1 , 1966 , the former State of Punjab ceased to exist . The successor States of Punjab , Haryana and Union Territory of Chandigarh and the transferred territory came into being . The controversy related to the service conditions of the respondents . The Court referred to the dictionary clause and Section 88 of the 1966 Act and came to hold thus : “ Law is defined in clause ( g ) of Section 2 of the Act to say : “ law ? includes any enactment , ordinance , regulation , order , bye - law , rule , scheme , notification or other instrument having , immediately before the appointed day , the force of law in the whole or in any part of the existing State of Punjab ; ” . We agree with the High Court that the impugned orders in question were not law within the meaning of Section 2(g ) and hence were , in terms , not saved by Section 88 . We think the High Court is right when it says : 21 ( 1976 ) 3 SCC 242 22 2017 ( 7 ) SCLAE 234 23 1964 ( 6 ) SCR 846
