249 England , 4 % Edition , Vol . 49(2 ) , paragraph 121 was extracted to underscore the parity in the rights of co - riparian claimants to a reasonable enjoyment and use of the water : “ 121 . Rights and duties as to quality of water . The right of a Riparian owner to the flow of water is subject to certain qualifications with respect to the quantity of water which he is entitled to receive . The right is subject to the similar rights of other Riparian owners on the same stream to the reasonable enjoyment of it , and each Riparian owner has a right of action in respect of any unreasonable use of the water by another Riparian owner ... A Riparian owner must not use and apply the water so as to cause any material injury or annoyance to his neighbours opposite , above or below him , who have equal rights to the use of the water and an equal duty towards him . ” 202 . The Tribunal next marked the advent of the Helsinki Rules of 1966 which rejected the Harmon doctrine and laid emphasis on the need of equitable utilization of such international rivers . The said Rules recognize equitable use of water by each basin State setting out the factors , not exhaustive though , to be collectively taken into consideration for working out the reasonable and equitable share of the riparian states . The indicated factors , inter alia , include the geography of the basin , the hydrology of the basin , the climate , past utilization of waters , economic and social needs of each basin State ,
