The Tribunal mentioned that till 1928 , the States of Mysore and Madras did resort to age old cultivation mostly of paddy crop wherever irrigation facilities were available in the Basin and whereas in Mysore , the paddy cultivation was provided irrigation through anicut canals or tanks , the same was the case also in Tamil Nadu where bulk of paddy cultivation was in the Cauvery Delta Area fed by Grand Anicut and through other Anicuts across Cauvery , Bhavani and Amaravathi and later on , with the installation of the Krishna Raja Sagara Reservoir ( KRS ) and the Mettur Reservoir as per the provisions of the 1924 Agreement , Mysore and Madras respectively extended their irrigation to new areas . The Tribunal noted that though after the construction of these two major reservoirs facilitating large scale irrigation facilities , the bulk of cultivation in both the States remained confined to Paddy crop , yet in Karnataka sugarcane which is a perennial crop was also resorted to .
