105 jurisdiction of this Court is barred . The jurisdiction of this Court is not taken away in respect of the dispute arising out of an ordinary agreement . The instruments referred to and described in the proviso are only those which are political in nature . Non - political instruments are not covered by the proviso . 75 . The 1886 Lease Agreement does provide for resolution of disputes between the parties to the agreement by way of arbitration : it contains an arbitration clause . The submission of Kerala that enforcement of any award under the arbitration clause would be political in nature is misplaced .

As a necessary corollary , the dispute arising out of the 1886 Lease Agreement is not barred under Article 131 proviso as well .
