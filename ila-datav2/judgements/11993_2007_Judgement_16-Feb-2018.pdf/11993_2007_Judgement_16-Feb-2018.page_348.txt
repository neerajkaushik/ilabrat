He argued that alternatively , the allocation of water could be done equitably and in accordance with justice by restoring equal rights to the party - States . He submitted that Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were co - equal States and that justice had to be done to both while allocating water , a fact which the Tribunal had failed to recognise . He submitted that the various applicable factors set out in the Helsinki Rules , 1966 were more or less evenly balanced between the two States and the same have not been kept in view . Further , based on the maxim that equality was equity , the balance or remaining volume of water available after subtracting the share of Kerala and Puducherry and after accounting for wastage ought to have been divided equally between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu . According to his calculations , Karnataka and Tamil Nadu would each get 339.5 TMC of water .
