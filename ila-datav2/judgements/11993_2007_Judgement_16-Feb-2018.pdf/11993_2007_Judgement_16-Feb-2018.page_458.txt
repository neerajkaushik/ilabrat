( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) 458 After coming into force of the 1947 Act , the doctrine of paramountcy has no room for application as the Government of India became the full sovereign authority . The two agreements of 1892 and 1924 had neither any political arrangement nor touched any facet of sovereignty of India . Per contra , the agreements cover the areas of larger public interest which do not have any political element and in this backdrop , the agreements are neither inoperative nor completely extinct . The issues in this case have no connection , whatsoever , with the concepts of sovereignty and integrity of India and , therefore , the bar under Article 363 of the Constitution of India is not attracted . Even if we accept the contention that the State of Karnataka did not have any bargaining power at the time of entering into the agreements , but , the State of Karnataka acquired the said bargaining power after the 1947 Act , and definitely after coming into force the Constitution of India . Regardless of the same , the State of Karnataka chose not to denounce the said agreements . Therefore , the said agreements can not be said to be unconscionable .
