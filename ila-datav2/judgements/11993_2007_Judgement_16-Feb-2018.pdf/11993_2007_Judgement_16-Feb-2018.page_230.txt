230 1934 - 35 to 1971 - 72 , the lowest recorded yield was during the period 1952 - 53 at 523 TMC according to Tamil Nadu and 516 TMC according to Karnataka . It noted that in the Cauvery basin , the fluctuation of the flows was not as high as in the Krishna or Narmada basin , such fluctuation between the lowest yield and the dependable yield being within 30 % in comparison to 56 % and 70 % in case of Krishna or Narmada . The Tribunal took note of the storage capacities of various reservoirs built by the States of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka before and after 1972 in the Cauvery basin . It also took into account the projects proposed by the State of Kerala having live storage of more than 1 TMC each totaling 19 TMC of live storage capacity in the basin . The fact that in addition , about 12 TMC of storage capacity was available from other small reservoirs with capacity of less than 1 TMC was taken cognizance of . The Tribunal , thus , concluded that the total storage capacity in the Cauvery basin was 330 TMC ( gross ) and 310 TMC ( live ) . It was of the view that about 42 % of 740 TMC ( i.e. , 50 % dependable yield ) could be stored in all the storage reservoirs in the Cauvery basin which was a very significant aspect for consideration in the development and utilization of water resources of a river basin .
