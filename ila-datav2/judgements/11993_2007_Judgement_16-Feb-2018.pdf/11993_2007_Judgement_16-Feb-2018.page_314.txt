314 267 . The Tribunal also referred to the observation of the Expert Committee headed by Shri C.C. Patel , the then Additional Secretary , Ministry of Irrigation and Power , against trans - basin diversions in a water deficit basin . It , therefore , concluded that because of shortage of water , no note could be taken of claims made by the States for apportionment of water in respect of any transbasin diversion already made or proposed to be made for any purpose . The Tribunal , thus , declined to allocate water for the projects involving transbasin diversion of waters . 268 . Qua the demand for irrigation , domestic and industrial water use , the Tribunal , on a scrutiny of the project reports as furnished in the common format , catalogued the following aspects : â€œ ( i ) Out of the irrigation schemes projected , only one scheme i.e. Karapuzha project had been approved by the Government of India . ( ii ) While the State had been emphasizing on spice and plantation crops , while placing demand , it had only submitted its requirement mainly for paddy and vegetable crop , besides indicating demand for domestic and industrial uses along with hydropower projects involving interbasin transfer of water . ( iii ) As regards culturable command area ( CCA ) and ayacut under individual projects , the extent of proposed ayacut was much less than CCA because of the physical nature of the area , which was undulating in character .
