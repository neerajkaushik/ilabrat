313 equitable share of a particular riparian State , even the shortage of water in the neighbouring basin which is outside the basin in question is to be considered , it would lead to an anomalous situation . In its view , though in the Helsinki Rules of 1966 , there is a reference of basin states , yet the process of diversion could not be executed by one of the riparian States at the cost of other lower riparian States affecting their irrigation , economy and social needs . The observation of the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal and the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal in substance to the effect that in the absence of any agreement , the prudent course may be to limit the diversion to the surplus waters left after liberally allowing for the pressing needs of basin areas , was reiterated . The following observations of the U.S. Supreme Court in State of New Jersey v. State of New York ( supra ) were also recorded : “ The removal of water to a different watershed obviously must be allowed at times unless States are to be deprived of the most beneficial use on formal grounds . Diversion of water from one river basin to another is viewed with distrust and resisted by the basin population . ”
