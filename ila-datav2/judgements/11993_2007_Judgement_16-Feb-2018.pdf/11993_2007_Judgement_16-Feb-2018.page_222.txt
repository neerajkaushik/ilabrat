222 available for utilization by Puducherry for its irrigation in the Karaikal region . P.4 Gross water available for apportionment    P.4(i ) Surface flow of water : 187 . Having thus laid the factual preface comprehending the relevant facets of the discord , the Tribunal next turned to determine the surface flow of Cauvery river to ascertain the volume of water dependably available for eventual allocation amongst the claimantsStates . For the said purpose , it initiated the scrutiny from the yield of the river . It noticed that the yield or the total available quantum of water in a river system was dependant on rainfall pattern , catchment area characteristics including soil and vegetal cover and various climatic parameters affecting evaporation and evapotranspiration in the basin . It also took note of the fact that the annual yield of a given basin varies from year to year depending upon the occurrence of rainfall and its intensity and distribution in time and space . It observed that in the assessment of total yield , the withdrawals of water , if any , for different uses had a bearing and that the total annual flow including upstream withdrawals at the terminal site out of the yield of a river system was required to be
