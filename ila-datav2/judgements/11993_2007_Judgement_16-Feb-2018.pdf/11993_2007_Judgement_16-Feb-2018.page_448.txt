448 the basin States , the concept of prescriptive right or right to the natural flow of any inter - state river has ceased to exist . Having regard to the historical facts which demonstrate the constraints suffered by Karnataka resulting in its limited access and use of the surface flow of Cauvery in spite of being the upper riparian state , compared to Tamil Nadu , then Madras presidency , as well as severally drought conditions in its 28 districts / taluks , we are inclined to award an additional quantity of water to it in the measure of 14.75 TMC in all , ic , 10 TMC ( on account of availability of ground water in Tamil Nadu ) + 4.75 TMC ( for drinking and domestic purposes including such need for the whole city of Bengaluru ) . On these considerations , we consider Karnataka to be more deserving amongst the competing States to be entitled thereto . Out of this , 14.75 TMC would be deducted from the quantum allocated by the Tribunal in favour of Tamil Nadu . In other words , the final allocation of the shares in view of this determination would be as hereunder : Karnataka : 284.75 ( 270 + 14.75 ) TMC Tamil Nadu ; 404.25 ( 419 â€” 14.75 ) TMC Kerala : 30 TMC
