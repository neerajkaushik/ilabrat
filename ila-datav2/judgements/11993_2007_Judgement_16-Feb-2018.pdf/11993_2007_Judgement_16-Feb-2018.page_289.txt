289 236 . The Tribunal took into account the claims made by the States for different quantities of water vis - a - vis the corresponding stages required for different crops , namely : . Nursery Preparation . Puddling while preparing the main field . . Evapo Transpiration . Percolation Losses . Effective rainfall and . System Efficiency NOuRWNeH 237 . It was noted that in deciding the reasonable Delta ( water depth ) required for a crop , all these factors had a vital role . On the aspect of land preparation , the Tribunal observed that as per Karnataka , its crop water requirement in respect of semi - dry crops was about 100 mm for field preparation in respect of semi - dry crops before the crops are sown and that normally the operation of sowing the seed was undertaken when the field was wet for easy ploughing and as wetting of the soil by rainfall was not certain as it depended upon the natural rainfall , provision for wetting the soil was to be made so that the sowing of the crop as per the crop calendar would become possible . The Tribunal , in this regard , adopted the overall Delta for these crops as indicated in the project reports of Karnataka .
