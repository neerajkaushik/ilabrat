103 denouncement of the 1886 Lease Agreement by the Ruler of Travancore under proviso to Section 7(1)(b ) . The Province of Madras was beneficiary of the Standstill Agreement . Surely , deletion of Section 177 has not affected the rights of Province of Madras . ” 80 . The Court analysed the opinions of the learned Judges expressed in Dr. Babu Ram Saksena ( supra ) and eventually held thus : “ 61.5 . A careful consideration of the judgment by Mukherjea , J. in Ram Babu Saksena would show that His Lordship ’s opinion has no application to a nonpolitical agreement such as the 1886 Lease Agreement . The observation of Mukherjea , J. , “ When as a result of amalgamation or merger , a State loses its full independent power of action over the subject - matter of a treaty previously concluded , the treaty must necessarily lapse . ... ” is in the context of an extradition treaty which is purely political in nature . In our view , Ram Babu Saksena is clearly distinguishable and does not help Kerala in its argument that the 1886 Lease Agreement lapsed on merger of the two States , Travancore and Cochin , into the United State of Travancore and Cochin . ” 81 . The Constitution Bench also addressed the issue whether the 1886 lease agreement was an Act of State and opined that the 1886 lease agreement is not political in nature . It distinguished the Constitution Bench decision in Virendra Singh and others v. State of U.P.2 and ruled that the said decision is distinguishable 8 ( 1955 ) 1 SCR 415 : AIR 1954 SC 447
