154 for the purpose of the State of Jharkhand carved out of the modification of either the Education Regulations or the Pharmacy Act by the competent Legislature , namely , the Parliament , that no such attempt was also made by the State of Legislature and in the Jharkhand and unless a person was qualified in terms of the Education Regulations , he could not get his name entered in the Register . We find considerable force in this submission . It is true that the Jharkhand was carved out with effect from 15.11.2000 . By virtue of Section 84 of the Bihar Reorganization Act , the Pharmacy Act and _ the Education Regulations applied . In the absence of any modification , alternation or repeal of either the Act or the Education Regulations by the competent Legislature , it could not be postulated that the law had ceased to be in force merely on the formation of the State of Jharkhand . Section 84 of the Bihar Reorganization Act , in our view , is clear . Moreover , it is not possible for the Court to contemplate a law less State as it were . If the argument of the Respondents were to be accepted , the position would be that there was no law relating to Pharmacy or regarding qualifications for getting recognition as a Pharmacist in the State of Jharkhand and it is yet to be made . In other words , until the same is made there will be a vacuum . Such an argument , unless compelled , can not be acceptable . The territories now forming the State of Jharkhand originally formed part of the State of Bihar , were governed by the Act and the Education regulations promulgated and adopted in terms of Section 85 of the Bihar Reorganization Act . This scheme of the Reorganization Act is consistent with the general principle that a law once made applicable to a territory will continue to apply to that territory unless its application is abrogated or dispensed with by the competent Legislature or authority or its replacement by any other law
