While noting that it had called for information in the common format whereby the States had been required to project their population for the year 2000 and 2025 for working out drinking water requirement , the Tribunal , however , decided to assess the drinking water requirement as in the year 2011 . On the basis of the information available , it held that only 1/3"Â¢ of the Bengaluru city lay within the Cauvery basin as was urged in the course of the arguments . It , therefore , limited its consideration of drinking water requirement of Bengaluru to that area only which was located within the Cauvery basin . It noticed that Karnataka had stated that the existing and ongoing drinking water schemes for the city were for 14.52 TMC in all as in June 1990 and also that it had claimed 30 TMC for Bengaluru city in its projection for 2025 . The Tribunal , as is perceptible , was disposed to work out the water requirement for urban and rural population on the basis of population projection of the basin for the year 2011 by adopting the percentage decennial growth for the year 1981 - 1991
