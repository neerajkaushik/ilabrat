435 Resources of Cauvery Delta estimated the available ground water in Cauvery Delta at 51.56 TMC . Apart from the above , Tamil Nadu , in its pleadings , admitted that the total ground water extraction during the year 1989 was approximately 28.4 TMC in the Cauvery sub - basin , 7.3 TMC in the Vennar sub - basin and 11.3 TMC in the Grand Anicut Canal area ( new Delta area ) totaling 47 TMC . Tamil Nadu , in its pleadings , also mentioned that in the old Delta , there was a scope of conjunctive use of ground water to the extent of 30 TMC . On the basis of these recorded and empirical inputs , the Tribunal returned a finding that in a normal year when there would be regular releases of water from Mettur , the bulk of contribution to ground water in the Cauvery sub - basin would be from such releases , but in any case , the contribution from surface irrigation and rainfall could by no means be overlooked . On weighing the pros and cons and having regard to the severe limitations in the mechanism for assessment of ground water resource , the Tribunal made an extremely safe estimate of 20 TMC of ground water which , in its view , could be used by Tamil Nadu conjunctively with surface water . In categorical terms , the Tribunal clarified that this quantum was arrived at after excluding the component of ground water
