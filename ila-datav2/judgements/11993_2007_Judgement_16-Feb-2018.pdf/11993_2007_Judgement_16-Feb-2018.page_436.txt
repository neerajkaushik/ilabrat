436 recharge from river water bilateral infiltration . In other words , the Tribunal estimated 20 TMC of ground water available in the State of Tamil Nadu which was independent of any contribution from the surface flow of the river Cauvery and , thus , could be construed to be a stock available with it unconnected with the yield of 740 TMC otherwise quantified for allocation . It is in this context that the assertion made on behalf of Karnataka that ground water being a renewable resource , if not extracted regularly , would reduce the absorption capacity of the underlying aquifer resulting in rain water / surface water turning into wastage as run - off and that the admission of Tamil Nadu in its pleadings of availability of 30/47 TMC as ground water warranted reduction of at least 20 TMC , as estimated by the Tribunal , from the final allocated share of Tamil Nadu with proportionate reduction in the quantum of water to be provided by Karnataka at the inter - state border , assumes significance . In our view , having regard to the overwhelming empirical data following multiple research studies by different authorities authenticating beyond doubt availability of replenishable ground water in the Delta areas of Tamil Nadu , 20 TMC of ground water quantified by the Tribunal is an eminently
