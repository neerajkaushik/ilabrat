177 experience gained and upon examination of the possibilities of further extension of irrigation within the territories of the respective States be subject to such modification and additions as may be mutually agreed upon as the result of such reconsideration . The submission of Mr. Nariman and Mr. Katarki appearing for the State of Karnataka is that the postulates in the clause have to be read as a whole and not in a truncated sense . According to them , the stipulations in Clauses ( iv ) to ( viii ) would be open for reconsideration taking into stock certain facts and circumstances and only thereafter , the modification and additions can be mutually agreed to . Emphasis is laid on the word ‘ reconsideration ’ . It is also argued by them that the stipulation in Clause ( xi ) can not be restricted to Clauses ( iv ) to ( viii ) as those clauses constitute the spine of the Agreement . It is their argument that the other clauses in the Agreement are so interdependent with the mentioned clauses that the others can not be excluded or eschewed . The intention of the parties is quite clear that the experience has to be seen in 50 years and thereafter , the whole thing is to be called for reconsideration and reconsideration can not be unilateral or , for that matter , automatic .
