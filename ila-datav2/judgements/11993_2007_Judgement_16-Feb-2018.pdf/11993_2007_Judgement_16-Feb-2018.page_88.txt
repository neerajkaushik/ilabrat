88 The emphasis of Mr. Nariman is on the words “ partake also of a political character ” . Stress is laid that when an agreement partakes a political character , the doctrine of paramountcy clause melts into insignificance by virtue of Section 7 of the 1947 Act . In this regard , he has placed reliance on Hemchand Devchand v. Azam Sakarlal Chhotamlal ’ . The effort of the learned senior counsel is to draw a distinction between categories of political cases and those which fall in the other categories . The relied upon passages from the said judgment read as follows : “ The real question is whether in cases like those now before their Lordships the action of the tribunals in Kathiawar , and of the Governor in Council on appeal from those tribunals , is properly to be regarded as judicial or as political . And at this point a distinction arises between the two cases under appeal ; because the first of them has been disposed of as a civil , the second as a political , case . x x x x x The further appeal to the Secretary of State in Council is a fact of clearer import . In Lord Salisbury 's Despatch of the March 23 , 1876 , the practice of such appeals is dealt with as a thing at that date already fully established , and it continues to the present day in civil as well as in political cases . This system of appeal to the Secretary of State affords strong evidence that the intention of Government is and always has been that the jurisdiction exercised in connection with Kathiawar should be political and not judicial in its character . ” 4 ( 1905 ) 33 IA 1 : ( 1906 ) ILR 33 Cal 219
