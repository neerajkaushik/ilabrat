However , a careful perusal of Exhibit P2 clearly shows that the RCC building is also a subject matter of the deed of exchange . The value of RCC building exceeds Rs . 100/- which is not in dispute . Section 118 of the TP Act defines ‘ exchange ’ as under : “ 118 . “ Exchange ” defined.-When two persons mutually transfer the ownership of one thing for the ownership of another , neither thing or both things being money only , the transaction is called an “ exchange ” . A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in manner provided for the transfer of such property by sale ” . 18 . It is clear from this provision that where either of the properties in exchange are immovable or one of them is immovable and the value of anyone is Rs.100/- or more , the provision of Section 54 of the TP Act relating to sale of immovable property would apply . The mode of transfer in case of exchange is the same as in the case of sale . It is thus clear that in the case of exchange of property of value of Rs . 100/- and above , it can be made only by a registered instrument . In the instant case , the exchange deed at Exhibit P2 has not been registered . 19 . Section 49 of the Registration Act , 1908 provides for the effect of nonregistration of the document which is as under : “ 49 . Effect of non - registration of documents required to be registered.-No document required by section 17
