father(tenant ) in his own house then such tenant can not be made to suffer the eviction decree once he complies with the requirements of sub - section(4 ) of Section 20 . 26 . In other words , the submission was that it is only when any member of tenant 's family is living with the tenant in the tenanted premises and if he owns any vacant residential building in the same city , the tenant can be deprived of the benefit of sub - section(4 ) of Section 20 but not otherwise . We find no merit in this submission . 27 . In our view , the language of proviso being plain and simple leaving no ambiguity therein , we can not read the words of the proviso , the way learned counsel for the appellant wants us to read therein to accept his submission . In our view , if such was the intention of the legislature , then the proviso would have been worded accordingly . Such is , however , not the case here . 13
