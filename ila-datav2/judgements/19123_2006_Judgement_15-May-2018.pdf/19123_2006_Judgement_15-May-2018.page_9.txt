4 . The Commissioner has wrongly shown ‘ B ’ Schedule Property inclusive of the whole by Survey Nos.988 without identifying the suit properties i.e. Survey Nos.983A and 990 . Old Survey No.988 correlates to R. Survey No.123/9 having an extent of 3 Acres 39 Cents in the exclusive property of this defendant which is not available to a partition . In this aspect , the Commissioner has not even taken note of the various documents filed by this defendant . 5 . The Commissioner exceeded his authority in allotting the share of the plaintiff inclusive of the whole Survey No.988 while this Hon’ble Court specifically directed him to allot the share of the plaintiff in Survey Nos.983A and 990 or in any of the both . 6 . Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the report of the Commissioner are mutually conflicting . Paragraph 6 of the report is totally in conflict with the plan showing the allotment . Plots B1 and B2 shown by the Commissioner in his plan explicitly come within Survey No.988 . So , the allotment of the share of the plaintiff inclusive of Survey No.988 is totally against the spirit of the order of this Hon'ble Court dated 27.04.1999 . Such an allotment totally deprives the exclusive right of this defendant over Survey No.988 . ” 14 . Considering the objections repeatedly filed by the second defendant reiterating that Survey No.988 falls within the description of the suit properties and that should be excluded from the properties to be partitioned , the trial court ought to have held an enquiry and directed the parties to adduce evidence as to the right claimed by the second defendant in old Survey No.988 ( R.S. No.123/9 ) and what was the basis on which the possession of the second defendant was upheld in the proceedings under Section 145 Cr . P.C. and in CRP No.45 of 1992 .
