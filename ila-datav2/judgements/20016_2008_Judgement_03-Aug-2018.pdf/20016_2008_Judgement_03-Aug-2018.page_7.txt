8 . On a different note we may notice that PW-7 ( Gena Ram ) who was one of the injured witnesses on account of the bomb thrown by the dacoits , has himself not identified any of the dacoits . It is indeed suspicious to note that the injured witness deposed that he arrived at the place of occurrence only after dacoits managed to run away . PW-9 ( the informant ) has also failed to identify any of the dacoits . It may not be out of context to note that even PW-10 and PW-12 , PW-8 and PW-4 have equivocally have failed to identify or recognize the said dacoits . This factor was considered by the High Court which may be noted from the impugned judgment . 9 . The second aspect is the lack of recovery and identification of stolen articles . It is already mentioned above that the recovery of the stolen article was limited to one dhoti , a blouse and a nose stud . These articles were recovered from Maheshwar Singh which have been identified only by PW-10 ( Gita Devi ) , PW-12 ( Indu Devi ) and PW-4 ( Uday Nath Jha ) . Although , number of witnesses including the family members witnessed the aforesaid dacoity , only three persons could individually identify three different objects separately which this Court finds suspicious to believe in . This Court in the light of facts and circumstances can not lend any credibility to the alleged allegations regarding dacoity .
