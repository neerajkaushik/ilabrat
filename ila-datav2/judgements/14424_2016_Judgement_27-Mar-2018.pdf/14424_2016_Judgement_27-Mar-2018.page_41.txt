41 its own unaccompanied by any of the consortium member . Despite the same , BVG India Limited ( respondent no.1 ) furnished the experience certificate of BVG Kshitij Waste Management Services Private Limited . No information whatsoever was given of the relationship / linkage of BVG Kshitij and respondent no.1 — BVG India Limited . Therefore , reliance placed by the respondent no.1 on the purported experience certificate issued in the name of BVG Kshitij Waste Management Services Pvt . Limited would not come to the help of the respondent no.1 to show its work experience . The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation ( PCMC ) Certificate dated 24.10.2013 is in Marathi and the same discloses that the work order was issued on 2.3.2012 . The PCMC Certificate thus neither shows three years ’ experience of BVG India Limited nor that BVG India Limited was carrying out garbage / waste collection of more than 300 MT per day . Since respondent no.1 has categorically mentioned in its bid under the column “ basic information about tenderer ” that no other company ( either joint venture or consortium ) is involved with BVG India Limited , respondent no.1 — BVG India Limited could not have relied upon the purported experience certificate issued in the name of BVG Kshitij Waste Management Services Pvt . Ltd.
