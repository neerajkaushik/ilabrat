In all fairness , respondent no.1 ought to have disclosed these factors in its bid .

The method for evaluation of the financial bid as applied by the High Court is also not proper , and is illogical . As mentioned supra , the technical expert , in our considered opinion , has rightly applied the following formula in respect of the bidders so far as financial bids are concerned : FL1 x 20 FL2 / FL3 / FL4 On the other hand , the High Court has redone the evaluating formula in which multiplication of 20 is not adopted : FL1 FL2 / FL3 / FL4
