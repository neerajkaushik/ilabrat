16 wisdom ( or the lack of it ) of the conduct of the Corporation , the same can not be assailed for making the Corporation liable . ( v ) In the matter of sale of public property , the dominant consideration is to secure the best price for the property to be sold and this could be achieved only when there is maximum public participation in the process of sale and everybody has an opportunity of making an offer . ( vi ) Public auction is not the only mode to secure the best price by inviting maximum public participation , tender and negotiation could also be adopted . ( vi ) The Financial Corporation is always expected to try and realise the maximum sale price by selling the assets by following a procedure which is transparent and acceptable , after due publicity , wherever possible and if any reason is indicated or cause shown for the default , the same has to be considered in its proper perspective and a conscious decision has to be taken as to whether action under Section 29 of the Act is called for . Thereafter , the modalities for disposal of the seized unit have to be worked out . ( viii ) Fairness can not be a one - way street . The fairness required of the Financial Corporations can not be carried to the extent of disabling them from recovering what is due to them . While not insisting upon the borrower to honour the commitments undertaken by him , the Financial Corporation alone can not be shackled hand and foot in the name of fairness . ( ix ) Reasonableness is to be tested against the dominant consideration to secure the best price . 16 . Likewise , in B.S.N. Joshi and Sons Ltd. v. Nair Coal Services Ltd.
