The technical parameters which were required to be measured were also indicated in Article III of the NIT . The financial bids of only those bidders who secured at least 60 % marks in the technical evaluations would be opened . The tender was to be awarded based on the final score arrived at by taking the total of the weighted scores of technical and financial evaluations as per the criteria mentioned in the NIT at Article III . Respondent no.1 scored low on technical evaluation inasmuch as it got 58.94 in the weighted score , whereas the successful bidder i.e. respondent no . 3 got a weighted technical score of 67.36 . On a final analysis based on technical and financial weighted scores , Global Waste Management Cell Pvt . Ltd. got first rank ( L1 bidder ) amongst the three bidders by getting the highest score .

During the pendency of these matters , on 26.04.2016 , this Court granted an interim order in favour of the successful bidder ,
