We can never countenance the manner in which such order was passed by the High Court which has compelled us to remand the matter to the High Court for deciding the writ petition afresh on merits . 16 ) In the light of the foregoing discussion , we allow the appeal , set aside the impugned order and remand the case to the Division Bench of the High Court for deciding the writ petition afresh on merits in accordance with law keeping in view our observations made supra . 17 ) We , however , make it clear that we have refrained from making any observation on merits of the controversy having formed an opinion to remand the case to the High Court for the reasons mentioned above . The High Court would , therefore , decide the writ petition , uninfluenced by any of our observations , strictly in accordance with law .
