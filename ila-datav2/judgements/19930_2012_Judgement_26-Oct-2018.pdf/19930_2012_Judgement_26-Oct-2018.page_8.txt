15 . In this view of the matter , there was no occasion for the High Court to have gone into this question in an appeal filed by the accused ( appellant herein ) as the same had attained finality . 16 . Second , in any event , five co - accused persons having also been acquitted of the charges framed against them under Section 148/149IPC , no case was made out against the appellant for his conviction under Section 148/149 ibid . In other words , once it was held by the Sessions Judge that all the six accused persons could not be convicted under Section 148/149 ibid and were accordingly acquitted and no appeal having been filed by the State against this part of the order , the High Court was not justified in convicting the appellant under Section 148/149IPC .
