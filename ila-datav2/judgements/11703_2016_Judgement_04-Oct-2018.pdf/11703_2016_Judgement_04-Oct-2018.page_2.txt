The High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellant - accused and allowed the appeal preferred by the State thereby enhancing the sentence of imprisonment from two years to seven years as aforesaid . 5 . We have heard Ms. Kamini Jaiswal , learned counsel appearing for the appellant as well as Ms. Jesal Wahi , learned counsel appearing for the respondent -State . 6 . Ms. Kamini Jaiswal , learned counsel appearing for the appellant , inter alia , submitted that the conviction of the appellant is not maintainable in view of want of sanction under Section 39 of the Arms Act . Since we are mainly concerned with the correctness of the conviction under Section 25(1AA ) , we do not propose to go into the question on want of sanction . 7 . Section 25(1AA ) of the Arms Act deals with manufacture , sale , transfer etc . of the prohibited arms . In this case , the prosecution has not adduced any evidence to show that the appellant - accused had indulged in manufacturing of arms or prohibited ammunition in contravention of section 7 . Since the prosecution has not adduced any evidence to substantiate the allegation of manufacture , in our view , the conviction of the appellant - accused under Section 25(1AA ) can not be sustained .
