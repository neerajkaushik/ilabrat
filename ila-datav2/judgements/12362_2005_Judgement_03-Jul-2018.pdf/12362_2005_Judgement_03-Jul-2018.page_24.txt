been attributed to them . We concur with the judgment of the High Court that they are also entitled for the benefit of doubt and entitled to be acquitted . PW-1 , PW-3 , PW-5 to PW-7 have in one voice deposed that A-13 hurled bomb on Kambagiri Ramudu due to which he died on the spot . The medical evidence is in conformity with the occular testimonies of all the eyewitnesses . On a detailed consideration of the evidence on record , we hold A-13 guilty of an offence punishable under Section 302 I.P.C. for causing the death of Kambagiri Ramudu ( Deceased No.4 ) . A-10 was armed with a sickle and A-15 was armed with a country - made bomb . There is no evidence about their using the weapons â€™ They had dragged Ayyappu Reddy ( Deceased No.2 ) to the back of the jeep . None of the eyewitnesses spoke about any attack made by A-10 and A15 on Ayyappu Reddy after he was dragged to the back of the jeep . As no specific role has been attributed to A-10 and A-15 regarding any attack on any of the deceased , we do not see any reason to interfere with their acquittal . A16 to A-37 , according to the evidence of the eyewitnesses , were armed with hunting sickles , iron pipes and bombs . 24
