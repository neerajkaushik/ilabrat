on which the Board was considering the offers of the three societies in its meeting on 10/14.05.2003 , the offer of appellant No.1 dated 03.03.2003 was with the Board for its consideration . 26 . Fourthly , the very fact that M / s Kamath Constructions entertained appellant No.1 ’s offer on 03.03.2003 and forwarded it to the Board was indicative of the fact that offer to purchase the flats of Powai Project could be made by any party either to the Board or to M / s . Kamath Constructions and had to be considered as being a valid offer made to the Board only . 27 . Fifthly , reading of appellant No.1l ’s letter dated 03.03.2003 to M / s . Kamath Constructions would clearly indicate that it was essentially an offer made by appellant No.1 to the Board for purchase of 110 flats for Rs.17 crores . In other words , it could not be treated as letter for soliciting some information from the Board as contended by the Board for its consideration . 17
