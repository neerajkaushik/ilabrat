28 . In our view , keeping in view these five factors which were admittedly present in the case , the Board was under a legal obligation to consider all the four offers ( appellant No.1 and the three societies ) in their meetings held on 10/14.05.2003 with a view to decide as to which one out of the four offers was the best one for its acceptance . 29 . Indeed , exclusion of appellant No.1l ’s offer dated 03.03.2003 and keeping appellant no.1 out from the zone of consideration by the Board in its meetings held on 10/14.05.2003 and only confining the consideration of the offers made by the three societies vitiates the entire decision of the Board taken on 10/14.05.2003 . 30 . In our view , appellant No.1 had a legitimate right and so the expectation that it would get equal treatment from the Board like the other three societies because all four were similarly situated while considering the issue of sale of flats of Powai Project . Indeed , there was no valid reason for the Board to exclude appellant No.1 ’s case / offer from the zone of consideration . 18
