While according approval to _ the Resolution , a discussion to this effect has been taken that if the amount is not paid within the time - limit , interest at the rate of 14.5 be charged on the arrears of the amount . A decision was also taken that if the Chief Promoters of the societies have not paid the sale price of the tenements within the period , allotment should be cancelled and amount of 10 % of the sale price be forfeited . It shows inconsistency therein it does not become clear as to how and when allotment shall be cancelled if the interest has to be charged on the amount of arrears and as to when 10 % of the sale price shall be forfeited . Hence it is necessary that there should be clarity in this respect . As per the notes taken by me in the meeting of the Authority , a draft is submitted herewith . However , after confirming the minutes in connection with the business of the meeting , an authorized Resolution be kindly made available so that it would be convenient for taking further action thereon . As the implementation of this Resolution has to be implemented without waiting for its confirmation , the Resolution of the Authority be kindly made available with necessary amendments in the enclosed draft resolution . Hence this request . Sd / Director , Marketing / M.B. Sd / Joint Chief Officer / M.B.
