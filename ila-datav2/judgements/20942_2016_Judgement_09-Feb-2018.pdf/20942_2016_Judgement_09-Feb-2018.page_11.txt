11 road but the High Court opined to the contrary without assigning any reason whatsoever . In our view , the Site Plan ( Ext . P-45 ) filed along with the charge - sheet does not support the finding recorded by the High Court that the Gas Tanker was not parked in the middle of the road . Notably , the High Court has also not doubted the claimant â€™s plea that the Gas Tanker/ offending vehicle was parked without any indicator or parking lights . The fact that PW-7 who was standing on the opposite side of the road at a distance of about 70 feet , could see the Gas Tanker parked on the other side of the road does not discredit his version that the Maruti Car coming from the opposite side could not spot the Gas Tanker due to flash lights of the oncoming traffic from the front side . It is not in dispute that the road is a busy road . In the cross - examination , neither has any attempt been made to discredit the version of PW-7 nor has any suggestion been made that no vehicle with flash lights on was coming from the opposite direction of the parked Gas Tanker at the relevant time .
