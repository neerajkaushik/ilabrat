5 it is required to be done in a criminal trial . The Court must keep this distinction in mind . Strict proof of an accident caused by a particular bus in a particular manner may not be possible to be done by the claimants . The claimants were merely to establish their case on the touchstone of preponderance of probability . The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt could not have been applied . 22 . After considering the submissions made by both the parties , I find that PW7 Sohan Lal eye - witness to the occurrence has specifically stated in his affidavit Ex . PW7 / A tendered in his evidence that on 15.12.2011 at about 20.30 p.m. he alongwith PHG Ajit Singh was present near Sanjha Chulha Dhaba on the National High Way leads to Jummu . All the traffic of road was diverted on the eastern side of the road on account of closure of road on western side due to construction work . In the meantime a Maruti car bearing No . HR-02-K-0448 came jrom Jammu side and struck against the back of Gas Tanker as the driver of the car could not spot the parked tanker due to the flash lights of the oncoming traffic from front side . Then they rushed towards the spot of accident and noticed that the said tanker was standing parked in the middle of the road without any indicators or parking lights . 23 . The statement of this witness clearly establishes that this was the sole negligence on the part of the driver of the gas tanker especially when the accident was caused on 15.12.2011 that too at about 10.30 p.m. which is generally time of pitch darkness . In this way , the driver of the car can not be held in any way negligent in this accident . Moreover , as per Rules 15 of the Road Regulations , 1989 no vehicle is to be parked on busy road .
