portion of which reads as under : “ The question is what do the words “ beneficially owned as respects all the shares therein ” mean in the context of the Act . These words are not defined in the Act . Apart from authority , we would construe them to refer only to such ownership of a ship as is vested in a person who has the right to sell , dispose of or alienate all the shares in that ship . Our construction would clearly cover the case of a ship owned by a person , who whether he is the legal owner or not , is in any case the equitable owner of all the shares therein . It would not , in our opinion , cover the case of a ship which is in the full possession and control of a person who is not also the equitable owner of all the shares therein . In our opinion , it would be a misuse of language to equate full possession and control of a ship with beneficial ownership as respects all the shares in a ship . The word “ ownership ” connotes title , legal or equitable whereas the expression “ possession and control ” , however full and complete , is not related to title . Although a person with only full possession and control of a ship , such as a demise charterer , has the beneficial use of her , in our opinion he does not have the beneficial ownership as respects all the shares in the ship and the ship is not “ beneficially owned as respects all the shares therein ” by him within the meaning of s.4(4 ) . ” 35 .
