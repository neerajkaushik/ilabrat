can not be a maritime claim in respect of Article 1(1)(f ) of the Arrest Convention . Consequently , there would be no occasion to arrest the vessel under Article 3(1)(b ) of the Arrest Convention as no maritime claim has resulted in the hands of the demised charterer with regard to the demised vessel . The maritime claim by either of the appellants could , thus , be enforced only by arresting another vessel owned by Reflect Geophysical and the de facto ownership , could not be converted into a de jure ownership . In respect of Article 1(1)(1 ) , it was , once again , held that there was no supply of goods to the vessel or of supply of services to the vessel in question , which was the respondent vessel . Insofar as the reasoning in Sunil B. Naik â€™s case , so far as Article 1(1 ) ( ) ) is concerned , it has been categorically found that it was not a case where goods had been given on hire or for use of the respondent vessel . Conclusion : 43 . On giving our thoughtful consideration to the issue at hand , we are in full agreement with the view taken by the Courts below and find no reason to interfere in appeal .
