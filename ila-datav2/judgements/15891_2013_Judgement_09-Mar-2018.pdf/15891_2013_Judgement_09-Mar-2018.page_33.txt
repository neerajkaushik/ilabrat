38 . The learned single Judge opined that the claim in Yusuf Abdul Gani â€™s case was in respect of use or hire of another ship Orion Laxmi and the claim , thus , could not be maintained against the respondent vessel . It was stated to be a claim in personam against Reflect Geophysical and thus , only a vessel owned by Reflect Geophysical could have been restrained . The learned single Judge also records that it has not been the case of Yusuf Abdul Gani that Reflect Geophysical is a de facto owner of the ship sought to be arrested and the position of an owner of a ship is different from a demised charter when it comes to the arrest of a vessel owned or chartered . In this behalf a reference has been made to the case of Polestar Maritime Ltd. v. M.V. Qi Lin Men & Ors . " where Article 3(2 ) of the Arrest Convention was elucidated specifying that a ship can be arrested in respect of a maritime claim against another ship only in the following circumstances : ( a ) The owner of both the ships is one and the same . ( b ) In case a maritime claim exists qua the owner of a ship , which is taken on a demised charter then the liability can be recovered by restraint of the ship owned by the charterer . 11Admiralty Suit ( Lodging ) No.3547/2008 decided on 22.10.2008 Page 33 of 57
