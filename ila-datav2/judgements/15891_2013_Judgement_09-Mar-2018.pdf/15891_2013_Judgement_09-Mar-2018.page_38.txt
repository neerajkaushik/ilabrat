they have a maritime claim but not in respect of the respondent vessel . The maritime claim is in respect of the vessels which are owned by the appellants and the party liable in personam is Reflect Geophysical . Were the respondent vessel put under the de jure ownership of Reflect Geophysical , the appellants would have been within their rights to seek a detention order against that vessel for recovery of their claims . 46 . In the facts of the present case the owners of the respondent vessel , in fact , also have a claim against Reflect Geophysical for unpaid charter amount . Thus , unfortunately it is both the owner of the respondent vessel on the one hand and the appellants on the other , who have a maritime claim against Reflect Geophysical , which has gone into liquidation . The appellants quite conscious of the limitations of any endeavour to recover the amount from Reflect Geophysical , have ventured into this litigation to somehow recover the amount from , in effect , the owners of the respondent vessel by detention of the respondent vessel . That may also be the reason why the appellants did not even think it worth their while to implead Reflect Geophysical against whom they have their claim in personam , possibly envisaged as a futile exercise .
