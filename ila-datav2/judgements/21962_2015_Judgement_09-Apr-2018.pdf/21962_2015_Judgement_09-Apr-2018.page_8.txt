13 . 14 . 8 offence under section 306 IPC . Accused Smt . Khushboo W / o Brijesh Singh D / o Dharampal Singh caste Bawaria , Age 25 years , Sushila W / o Shri Dharampal Singh caste Bawaria , Age 43 years and Dharampal Sing S / o late Shri Ram Singh caste Bawaria , Age 45 years were arrested in this case . Remaining enquiry . Accused Hawa Singh could not be arrested since he was absconding and since 8.8.2014 , the Honâ€™ble High Court has stayed the investigation . The Status Report of facts is being sent to you . ( emphasis supplied ) In light of the fact that the enquiry was pending and there are aspects which may require investigation , we are of the considered opinion that the High Court erred in quashing the FIR at the threshold itself without allowing the investigation to proceed . We can not agree with the reasons provided under the impugned judgment concerning certain factual assertions made by the Respondents as to the condition of the deceased and reasons for committing suicide because acceptance of the said would not be in consonance with the settled jurisprudence under Section 482 of CrPC as laid down by various judgments of this Court . It would be relevant to note that any observation made herein should not be taken as observations on merits and we direct the investigative authority as well as the court to consider the matter on its own merits uninfluenced by any observation herein .
