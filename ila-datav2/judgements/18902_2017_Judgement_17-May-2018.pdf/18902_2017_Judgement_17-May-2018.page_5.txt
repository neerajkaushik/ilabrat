profits made by WPL during the period when the arrangement subsisted . Since WPL was to be refunded the entire investment made by it with interest , it was evident that the profits realised by it during the subsistence of the arrangement would have to be deducted . 6 In order to give effect to the above directions , the order of this Court envisaged a process of verification by Controller and Auditor General of India ( CAG ) . The CAG was directed to nominate an auditor to verify the income and expenditure incurred by WPL and the profits earned from the Super Bazar establishment . The determination by the auditor was required to be verified by CAG , upon which it would be binding upon by the parties concerned . WPL was directed to handover all the movable and immovable properties of Super Bazar to the OL . 7 The role which was ascribed to CAG emerges from the following extract , from the order of this Court dated 29 March 2016 : “ In order to effectuate the refund referred to hereinabove 5 ( to M / s Writers and Publishers Ltd. ) , we consider it just and appropriate to direct the Comptroller and Auditor General of India , to nominate an Auditor , to verify the income and expenditure incurred by M / s Writers and Publishers Ltd. , and also , the profits earned by it from the Super Bazar establishment , during the period under consideration . The determination so made by the Auditor , will be verified by the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India , whereupon , the same shall be binding on all the parties including M / s Writers and Publishers Ltd. Needless to mention , that all interested parties shall have the liberty to appear before the nominated Auditor , and canvass their respective claims . ”
