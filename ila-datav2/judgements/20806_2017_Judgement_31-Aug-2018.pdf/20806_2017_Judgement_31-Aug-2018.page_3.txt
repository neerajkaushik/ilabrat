5 . The High Court accepted the contention of the appellant that the deceased was not a third party and that the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle . However , the High Court directed the appellant to pay the compensation with a rider that the said order shall not be treated as a precedent . On perusal of the policy of the insurance , the High Court in the course of the order observed that indemnification extended to personal accident of the owner - cum - driver was limited to the extent of Rs.2,00,000/- . The finding of the High Court on this question is as under : " As it has been established by the claimantrespondents that the premium was paid for the personal accident the insurance company is liable to pay the said compensation , even though it is limited to Rs.2,00,000/- to the   claimantrespondents . There is no challenge , however , against the determination of the compensation . " 6 . Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that the deceased himself was driving the offending vehicle and has caused the accident . No other vehicle was involved in the accident . He can not be treated as a third party . Therefore , the High Court has rightly held that the claim petition filed by the respondents was not maintainable . In view of this finding , the High Court was not justified in directing the appellant to pay the compensation .
