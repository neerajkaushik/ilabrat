on the roadside as a result of which he died . The Court held that the claim petition filed by his LRs was not maintainable . It was held thus : " 10 . The deceased was the owner of the vehicle . For the reasons stated in the claim petition or otherwise , he himself was to be blamed for the accident . The accident did not involve motor vehicle other than the one which he was driving . The question which arises for consideration is that the deceased himself being negligent , the claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988 would be maintainable . 11 . Liability of the insurer Company is to the extent of indemnification of the insured against the respondent or an injured person , a third person or in respect of damages of property . Thus , if the insured can not be fastened with any liability under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act , the question of the insurer being liable to indemnify the insured , therefore , does not arise " . 9 . Therefore , the High Court was not justified in directing the appellant / insurer to pay the compensation determined by the Tribunal . Since the indemnification extended to personal accident of the deceased is limited to Rs . 2,00,000/- under the contract of insurance , the respondents are entitled for the said amount towards compensation . Hence , the appellant is directed to deposit the said sum of Rs . 2,00,000/- with interest @ 9 per cent per annum
