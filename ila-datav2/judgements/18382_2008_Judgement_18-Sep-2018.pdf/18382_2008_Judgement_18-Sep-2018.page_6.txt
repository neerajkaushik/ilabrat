Appellant did not assail the findings of the Rent Controller on issue No.1 pertaining to default in payment of rent . We can not permit the Appellant to make submissions for payment of default of arrears of rent at this stage . 7 . The main point urged on behalf of the Appellant is that the premises which was let out for saw mill is now being utilized for the purpose of manufacturing of grills which amount to change of user . Submissions were made before us by both sides on the interpretation of terms of the rent agreement . On a perusal of the agreement , we are convinced that there is no restriction placed on the Respondents - tenant to run business only relating to the saw mill . The tenant was given the liberty to carry on any other business as well . In the absence of any negative covenant the user does not amount to user for the purpose other than for which the premises was leased . ’ . A premises taken on rent for ‘ Sugarcane crushing ’ was used for cloth business in which case the landlord ’s contention that there was change of user was rejected ’ . We agree 1 Mohan Lal v.
