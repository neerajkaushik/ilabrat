21 the Gujarat High Court judgment ( supra ) , merely refers to Article Ill of the New York Convention to state that so far as procedural aspects relatable to foreign awards are concerned , we must go by the Code of Civil Procedure , and going by the Code of Civil Procedure , the Court at Bhavnagar would have no jurisdiction to enforce the foreign award in the facts of that case . Since Article III of the New York Convention is strongly relied upon by Shri Viswanathan , we need to set it out . It states : “ Article Ill Each Contracting State shall recognise arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon under the conditions laid down in the following articles . There shall not be imposed substantially more onerous conditions or higher fees or charges on the recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards to which this Convention applies than are imposed on the recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards . ” 23 . There is no doubt whatsoever that if stamp duties are leviable in India on foreign awards , the imposition should not be substantially more onerous than the stamp duty that is imposed on recognition or enforcement of domestic arbitral awards . For the said Article to apply , stamp duty must first be leviable on a foreign award , which , as we have held earlier in this judgment , is not the case . Equally , reliance upon the 194 " Law Commission of India Report , insofar as stamp duty on domestic awards is concerned , would again have little bearing , given our finding that under the present state of the law , foreign awards are not liable to stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act , 1899 .
