Civil Appeal No.4802 of 2018 etc . Rameshwar Prasad Shrivastava & Ors . Vs . Dwarkadhis Projects Pvt . Ltd. & Ors . said application also contained an Application under Section 12(1)(c ) of the Act . 5 . Ms. Priyanjali Singh , Advocate for the Complainants at the time of arguments in this case , on instructions , stated that the Complainants did not wish to press I.A.No.12680 of 2017 seeking amendment of the Complaint and requested the Complaint should be dealt with as filed earlier . Hence , I.A.No.12680 of 2017 was dismissed as not pressed . ‚Äù 8 . It was observed that since there was no application under Section 12(1)(c ) of the Act , in view of the decision rendered by larger Bench of the National Commission in Ambrish Kumar ( supra ) , the complaint in the instant case was not maintainable . The National Commission thus by its order dated 13.02.2018 dismissed the aforesaid Consumer Case No.250 of 2013 as not being maintainable . Similarly , by order dated 08.08.2018 the National Commission dismissed Complaint Case No.43 of 2014 preferred by 4 buyers in respect of same project of the first respondent as not being maintainable . 9 . These appeals thus question the correctness of the decisions of the National Commission and raise issues concerning maintainability of the complaints . At this stage we may extract the relevant provisions of the Act .
