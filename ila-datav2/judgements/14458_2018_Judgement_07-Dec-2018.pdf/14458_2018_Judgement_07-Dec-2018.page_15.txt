Civil Appeal No.4802 of 2018 etc . Rameshwar Prasad Shrivastava & Ors . Vs . Dwarkadhis Projects Pvt . Ltd. & Ors . clear and does not admit of any other interpretation . It was laid down by this Court in Babu Manmohan Das Shah & ors . v. Bishun Das ? as : “ The ordinary rule of construction is that a provision of a statute must be construed in accordance with the language used therein unless there are compelling reasons , such as , where a literal construction would reduce the provision to absurdity or prevent the manifest intention of the legislature from being carried out . ” If we accept the submission of the appellants , the category of persons referred to in Section 13(6 ) of the Act , with the aid of requisite permission in terms of Order I Rule 8 of the CPC could maintain a class action which may bind similarly placed consumers but those referred to in Section 12(1)(c ) would be a different category who would not be bound by the provisions of Order I Rule 8 of CPC . In essence a separate category of persons as consumer / consumers would be entitled to maintain an action under Section 12(1)(c ) of the Act . In our considered view that certainly is not the intent . If we accept the submission , we would be going against the express mandate of the statute . All that such interpretation would help achieve for some consumers is to maintain an action in a forum with higher pecuniary jurisdiction where , but for such collective cause of action , the action would not lie in such forum with higher pecuniary jurisdiction . 3(1967 ) 1 SCR 836 at page-839
