Civil Appeal No.4802 of 2018 etc . Rameshwar Prasad Shrivastava & Ors . Vs . Dwarkadhis Projects Pvt . Ltd. & Ors . 16 15 . We , therefore , find that the view taken by the National Commission in the case of Ambrish Kumar ( supra ) is consistent with the text of the provisions and is the correct view . The National Commission , in the present case , was therefore justified in holding Consumer Case Nos . 250 of 2013 and 43 of 2014 to be not maintainable . 16 . During the course of hearing we had asked Ms. Singh , learned counsel if the appellants were willing to proceed with the requirements under Section 13(6 ) of the Act and take appropriate steps as mandated under Order 1 Rule 8 CPC . She , however , responded that the entire process being prohibitive in terms of cost , her clients were unwilling to proceed in that behalf . It must however be noted that the matters were pending with the National Commission for more than three years during which time the pleadings were exchanged and the evidence was filed . In the circumstances , though we uphold the view taken by the National Commission , the proper course would be to enable the appellants to approach the concerned State Commission . If the State Commission is so approached , the matter shall not be proceeded de novo but from the stage at which it was before the National Commission .
