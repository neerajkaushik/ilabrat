5 deficiencies at Serial Nos.3 , 6 and 7 . The Respondent College by its letter dated 24.03.2018 claimed to have rectified all the deficiencies and accordingly a compliance verification was carried out by the assessors of MCI on 13.04.2018 . This verification found that the deficiencies continued to persist and therefore the Executive Committee in its Meeting held on 26.04.2018 decided to recommend to the Central Government not to grant renewal of permission for admitting students for the academic year 20182019 . This decision was squarely put in challenge by filing writ petition No.400 of 2018 in this Court which was dismissed on 01.05.2018 leaving all questions open . 7 . On 07.05.2018 and 09.05.2018 the Respondent College requested the Central Government to grant personal hearing before any adverse order could be passed . The request was however declined by the Central Government on 17.05.2018 , as the Respondent College was already granted personal hearing in the matter . The respondent being aggrieved , challenged the decision dated 17.05.2018 by filing civil writ petition No.13366 of 2018 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana .
