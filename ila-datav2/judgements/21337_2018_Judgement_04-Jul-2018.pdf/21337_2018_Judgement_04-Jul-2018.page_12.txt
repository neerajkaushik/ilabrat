Granting admission to students in an educational institution when there is a serious doubt whether admission should at all be granted is not a matter to be taken lightly . First of all the career of a student is involved — what would a student do if his admission is found to be illegal or is quashed ? Is it not a huge waste of time for him or her ? Is it enough to say that the student will not claim any equity in his or her favour ? Is it enough for student to be told that his or her admission is subject to the outcome of a pending litigation ? These are all questions that arise and for which there is no easy answer . Generally speaking , it is better to err on the side of caution and deny admission to a student rather than have the sword of Damocles hanging over him or her . There would at least be some certainty . 28 .
