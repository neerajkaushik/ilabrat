17 . Similarly , in schools located within the Municipal limit of the capital cities , islands , North Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir the minimum land requirement shall be 1 acre . In other words , the CBSE has introduced a degree of flexibility depending upon the location of the school . Unfortunately , Kerala has not even thought of providing any such flexibility . It appears to us that the rigid requirement of Kerala indicates that it is imposed upon the schools that seek affiliation with the CBSE only with a view to unnecessarily burden them with an onerous and arbitrary condition , since Kerala believes it has the authority to do so . 18 . Keeping all this in mind , we had required Kerala by an order dated 6 " December , 2016 to inform us the number of schools run by the State Government or aided by the State Government or affiliated with the State Board that do not comply with the guidelines of 7 " October , 2011 . In response , Kerala filed an evasive affidavit to the effect that since the guidelines do not apply to such schools , there is no compulsion on such schools to comply with them . This is remarkable â€” guidelines are framed by Kerala for application by schools other than those run by the State Government or aided by the State Government or affiliated with the State Board . There is no reason given for this distinction drawn by Kerala which appears to be completely arbitrary . SLP ( Civil ) Nos . 18475 - 18476 of 2013 etc . etc . Page 8 of 13
