11 . By the impugned judgment and order dated 14 " September , 2012 , the High Court struck down clause ( iv ) and ( xiv ) of the guidelines dated 7 " October , 2011 and it is under these circumstances that the present petitions have been filed by Kerala and taken up for consideration . 12 . At the outset , we may note that although initially four guidelines were under challenge before the learned Single Judge but before us it was stated by learned counsel for school managements that they do not press the challenge to guidelines ( vi ) and ( viii ) . We are , therefore , concerned only with guidelines ( iv ) and ( xiv ) pertaining to a school seeking affiliation requiring minimum 3 acres of land and a minimum 300 enrolled students . Requirement of minimum 3 acres of land 13 . According to Kerala , a school seeking an NOC for affiliation to the CBSE must have 3 acres of land out of which 2 acres should be contiguous and in the actual location of the school . We have not been shown any basis for this mandate , applicable to all schools across the board . 14 . On the other hand , the CBSE appears to have done its homework in framing the Affiliation Bye - laws and making a realistic assessment of the requirements of schools depending on their location .
