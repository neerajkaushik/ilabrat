pay the required wages of the staff and the teachers except by charging exorbitant fees . There is no material on record to substantiate such a conclusion and it is based merely on the ipse dixit of the State . In the absence of any material on record justifying the fixation of a minimum of 300 students in a school seeking an NOC for affiliation to the CBSE , we must hold the requirement as arbitrary and we do so . 28 . Another issue raised by the management of schools is with regard to the compulsory unique identification ( UID ) for enrolment of students . We leave this issue open , as suggested by learned counsel , to await the decision of Constitution Bench of this Court which is presently seized of the requirement of UID . 29 . For the aforesaid reasons , we find no merit in these petitions which are accordingly dismissed . The interim applications stand disposed of . lieeececeeeseeeesesecececeese J ( Madan B.
