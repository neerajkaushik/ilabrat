executive fiat . Unfortunately , in this batch of petitions , the State of Kerala seeks to impose its authority over schools that provide apparently quality education , which is perceived to be a threat to the public education system in the State . 23 The challenge by the State of Kerala in this batch of petitions is to the judgment and order dated 14 ° September , 2012 passed by a Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala . In our opinion , all these petitions deserve to be dismissed . Brief background 3 . Without going into any great detail into the history ( which is replete with litigation — as if schools have nothing better to do ) leading up to these petitions , it needs to be said that the affiliation of schools by the Central Board of Secondary Education ( CBSE ) is governed by its Affiliation Bye - laws . Clause 3(i ) of the Bye - laws mandates formal prior recognition by the State / Union Territory Government . Additionally , the application for affiliation should be forwarded by the State Government or there should be a No Objection Certificate ( NOC ) to the effect that the State Government has no objection to the affiliation of the school with the CBSE . 4 . Apparently with this in mind , the State of Kerala issued certain guidelines on 13 " June , 2007 limiting consideration of applications for SLP ( Civil ) Nos . 18475 - 18476 of 2013 etc . etc .
