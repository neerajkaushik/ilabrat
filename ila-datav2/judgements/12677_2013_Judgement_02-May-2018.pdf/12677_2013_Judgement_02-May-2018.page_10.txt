non - realistic inflexibility of Kerala which too has some hilly areas where perhaps it might be difficult to find 3 acres of land . It is this lack of pragmatism and arbitrary rigidity that has weighed with the High Court as well as with us in coming to the conclusion that guideline ( iv ) requiring a minimum of 3 acres of land for obtaining an NOC for getting affiliation in accordance with the Affiliation Bye - laws of the CBSE is arbitrary and was deservedly struck down by the High Court . Minimum enrolment of 300 students 21 . The second challenge is with reference to the minimum strength of students being 300 in a school that seeks affiliation with the CBSE in terms of guideline ( xiv ) . 22 . At this stage , it may be mentioned that in Queen Mary Public School v. State of Kerala â€™ the High Court held that the requirement of 500 students on the rolls for affiliation of the school from Standard I to Standard X is contrary of the CBSE Affiliation Bye - laws and is not rational or sustainable . Notwithstanding this , Kerala has insisted on the number of students on the rolls being at least 300 for the issuance of an NOC . Since there is no such requirement under the CBSE Affiliation Bye - laws - this is merely an unwarranted imposition by Kerala on school managements . 1 ( 2007 ) 4 KLT 706 SLP ( Civil ) Nos . 18475 - 18476 of 2013 etc . etc .
