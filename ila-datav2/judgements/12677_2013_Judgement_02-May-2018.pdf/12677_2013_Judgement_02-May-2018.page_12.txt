school having 30 children in one class and having one division will have only 180 students upto and including Standard VI . Such a school can not , therefore , obtain provisional affiliation for secondary or senior secondary classes . Actually , such a school would not be eligible for affiliation till Standard X when it has 300 students â€” and it can never reach that stage since Standard IX and X can be started only if the school has CBSE affiliation . Kerala is , therefore , expecting an impossibility from such schools that strictly conform to the provisions of the RTE Act . 26 . On the other hand , under the KER the minimum effective strength per standard in Lower Primary / Upper Primary and High Schools is 25 students ( it would now have increased to 30 students ) . It is only for schools seeking CBSE affiliation that it is prescribed that the number of students should not be less than 300 . We do not see how , if the number of students is less than 300 , it will detract from the quality of education imparted to the students . In other words , the requirement of a minimum strength of 300 students is a completely arbitrary figure arrived at by Kerala and which has no rational nexus with quality education or the CBSE Affiliation Bye - laws . 27 . According to learned counsel for Kerala , if a school does not have a minimum of 300 students , it would be difficult for that school to SLP ( Civil ) Nos . 18475 - 18476 of 2013 etc . etc .
