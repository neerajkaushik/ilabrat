19 . It was submitted on behalf of Kerala that nevertheless the State Government was well within its rights and authority to provide for a minimum of 3 acres of land for the grant of an NOC . While this may be so , the requirement must have some rational basis but we are unable to find any such rational basis . Even in the counter affidavit filed before the learned Single Judge it is stated by Kerala that restrictions have been placed on CBSE schools to prevent their mushrooming growth which would affect the public education system in the State . No details have been given for arriving at this conclusion . But the very fact that there is a mushroom growth of CBSE schools is an indication that the public education system in Kerala as managed by the State Government leaves something to be desired in terms of the quality of the education . How does the restriction imposed by Kerala benefit the children of the State ? 20 . As mentioned above , the CBSE has done its homework well and has taken a pragmatic view of the requirement of land . We can take judicial notice of the fact that in metropolitan and capital cities as well as in hilly areas , it would be difficult to get 3 acres of land or even 2 acres of land . Similarly , due to the terrain it would perhaps be difficult to get adequate land in the North Eastern region of the country as well as in Jammu & Kashmir . This realism deserves to be contrasted with SLP ( Civil ) Nos . 18475 - 18476 of 2013 etc . etc . Page 9 of 13
