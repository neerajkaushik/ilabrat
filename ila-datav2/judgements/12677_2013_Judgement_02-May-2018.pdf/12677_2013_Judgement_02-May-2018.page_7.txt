15 . In Chapter IV of the Kerala Education Rules , 1959 ( for short ‘ KER ’ ) , we have been informed by learned counsel for Kerala that it is provided that Upper Primary Schools with or without Lower Primary Section ( that is up to and including Standard V and VI ) , the land requirement ( as informed ) is 1.2 to 2 hectares ( 3 to 5 acres ) ; for Secondary Schools the land requirement is 1.2 to 2 hectares ( 3 to 5 acres ) and for Higher Secondary Schools the land requirement is 1.2 hectares ( 3 acres ) . Hence the minimum requirement is of 3 acres of land . However , the KER provides that every school should normally have a minimum site area as indicated above . 16 . Contrast this with the CBSE Affiliation Bye - laws . Under these Bye - laws , the minimum land requirement varies from location to location . The requirement generally for an educational institution to apply to the CBSE for affiliation is that the school must have 2 acres of land but there are certain exceptions . For example , in cities with a population exceeding 25 lakhs the land should not be less than | acre with adequate building and arrangement with other institution / organization for imparting physical and health education and for conducting games to the satisfaction of the CBSE . In hilly areas , the land should not be less than 1 acre and the norms as prescribed by the Planning Commission would be applicable for determining hilly areas .
