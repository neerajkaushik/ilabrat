commencement of admissions for this year . . It is clear from the record that the Medical Council of India decided to make certain changes to the method of admissions to the Postgraduate Courses to arrest the blocking of seats by certain candidates which was detrimental to the interest of meritorious candidates in the All India Quota . There is material on record to suggest that devious methods were adopted by certain candidates to block the seats in the All India Quota and resign thereafter from those seats later which resulted in reversion of the All India Quota seats to the State Quota . The Medical Counselling Committee identified about thousand candidates who were indulging in such illegal practice and proposes to take action against them after a thorough inquiry . . There is no infringement of any legal right of the Petitioners in the change of the method of Counselling made by the notice dated 09.04.2018 . Reduction of chances of admission does not entail in violation of any right . If the change in the method of Counselling was due to the circumstances mentioned above , we see no reason to interfere . Further , the Petitioners have participated in the second round of Counselling for up - gradation . We are informed that the second round of Counselling for All India Quota is completed . No interference is warranted at this stage in respect of the All India Quota .
