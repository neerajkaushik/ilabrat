2 . The suit was filed by the plantiffs / respondents for recovery of possession and arrears of rent against the defendant / appellant herein . The appellant was a tenant of the respondents . The property in question is a residential house . The Trial Court , the first Appellate Court and the High Court have concurrently concluded that the plantiff is entitled to get possession of the suit property and arrears of rent . Thus , the suit was decreed against the tenant by such concurring judgments . Thereafter , an execution petition was filed in 2006 for executing the decree .

In sum and substance , the case of the appellant is that the execution petition ought to have been filed within 12 years from the date of the judgment of the Trial Court without waiting for the decision of the First Appellate Court or the Second Appellate
