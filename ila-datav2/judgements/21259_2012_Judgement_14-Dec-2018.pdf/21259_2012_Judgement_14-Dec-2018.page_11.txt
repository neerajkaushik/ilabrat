15 . Rights of the parties stand crystallised on the date of institution of the suit . However , in appropriate cases , court can take note of all the subsequent events . Observing that the court may permit subsequent event being introduced into the pleadings by way of amendment as it would be necessary to do so for the performance of determining the rule in controversy for the parties provided certain conditions are being satisfied , in Om Prakash Gupta v. Ranbir B. Goyal , ( 2002 ) 2 SCC 256 , it was held as under : â€œ 11 .

In Pasupuleti Venkateswarlu v. Motor & General Traders ( 1975 ) 1 SCC 770 , this Court held that a fact arising after the lis , coming to the notice of the court and having a fundamental impact on the right to relief or the manner of moulding it and brought diligently to the notice of the court can not be blinked at .

The Court speaking through Krishna lyer , J. affirmed the proposition that the court can , so long as the litigation pends , take note of updated facts to promote substantial justice . However , the Court cautioned : ( / ) the event should be one as would stultify or render inept the decretal remedy , ( i/ ) rules of procedure may be bent if no specific provision or fair play is violated and there is no other special circumstance repelling resort to that course in 11
