supplied by respondent Nos.1 & 2 did not make sense and the access to the original chip is necessary as the allegation against the appellant is of connivance in making of false allegations against one of the candidates . Respondent Nos.1 & 2 ’s contentions :    11 . On the other hand , Mr. Kapil Sibal , learned Senior Advocate appearing for the first two respondents ( Original petitioners in the High Court ) at the threshold itself stated that he has no quibble with all the legal propositions advanced by the learned senior counsel for the appellant or with the judicial pronouncements referred to aforesaid , however , what was sought to be canvassed was an _ incorrect representation of what has actually transpired . In this behalf learned senior counsel , once again , drew our attention to the notings to contend that the mention of “ E.P. filed : 11.07.16 ” is obviously a mistake as undisputedly the election petition was presented on 1.7.2016 . The endorsement of the Deputy Registrar shows that the scrutiny took place on 5.7.2016 . The eight defects noticed aforesaid were mentioned on 7.7.2016 whereupon the petition was placed before the learned Judge on 18.7.2016 as an unnumbered election petition .
