24 31 ~+For these reasons , we are of the view that challenges in regard to the validity of the elections to the uncontested seats in the panchayats , panchayat samitis and zilla parishads must also be pursued in election petitions under Section 79(1 ) of the Panchayat Elections Act . We leave it open to any person aggrieved to raise a dispute in the form of an election petition in accordance with the provisions contained in the Panchayat Elections Act . In exercise of the power conferred by Article 142 , we direct that the period of 30 days for filing election petitions in respect of the uncontested seats shall commence from the date of the publication of the results in the Official Gazette . 32 For the reasons indicated earlier , we allow the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the Calcutta High Court directing the acceptance of nominations in the electronic form . Pending applications , if any , are also disposed of . There shall be no order as to costs . sassmnaaoneecpesursna manuensenrenresunea CJl [ DIPAK MISRA ] aunanexnunscracenueeenrenrnecamvestesea J [ AM KHANWILKAR ] ene ecuesan ron geet eranecrmmemneratnsamocesd J [ Dr D Y CHANDRACHUD ] New Delhi August 24 , 2018
