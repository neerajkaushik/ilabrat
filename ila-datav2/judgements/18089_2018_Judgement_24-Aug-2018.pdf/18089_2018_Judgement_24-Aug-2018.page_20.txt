20 has to be espoused by adopting a remedy which is known to law namely through an election petition . It is at the trial of an election petition that factual disputes can be resolved on the basis of evidence . This principle has been consistently adhered to in decisions of this Court . In Boddula Krishnaiah ( supra ) , a three Judge bench , adverted to the decisions of the Constitution Bench in NP Ponnuswami v Returning Officer , Namakkal Constituency ® and in Lakshmi Charan Sen v AKM Hassan Uzzaman * . After referring to Ponnuswamy , it was observed : “ In| NP Ponnuswamy v _ Returning Officer , Namakkal Constituency a Constitution Bench of this Court had held that having regard to the important functions which the legislatures have to perform in democratic countries , it has always been recognised to be a matter of first importance that elections should be concluded as early as possible according to time schedule and all controversial matters and all disputes arising out of elections should be postponed till after the elections are over so that the election proceedings may not be unduly retarded or protracted . In conformity with the principle , the scheme of the election law is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the ‘ election ’ ; and if any irregularities are committed , while it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which under the law by which elections are governed , would have the effect of vitiating the ‘ election ; and enable the person affected to call it in question , they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dispute before any court while the election is in progress . ” The binding principle must be followed . 5 1952 SCR 218 6 ( 1985 ) 4 SCC 689
