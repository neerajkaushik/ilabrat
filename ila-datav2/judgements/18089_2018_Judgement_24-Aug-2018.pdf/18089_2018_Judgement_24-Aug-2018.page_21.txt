21 28 The intervention of this Court has been sought on the basis that free and fair elections are a part of the basic feature of the Constitution . Mr Patwalia urged , the entire electorate vicariously is a party to the contest . Exercise of the jurisdiction by this Court has been sought on the ground that the process of election was polluted , there having occurred large scale obstructions to the filing of nomination papers by candidates . The submission is that as many as 20,159 seats have gone uncontested and an overwhelmingly large majority of them have been bagged by candidates supported by the ruling dispensation in the State of West Bengal . Mr Patwialia urged that there is contemporaneous material to indicate that as a result of obstruction and violence , candidates were prevented from filing their nominations . Mr Patwalia invoked the observations contained in the judgment of this Court in Mohinder Singh Gill v The Chief Election Commissioner , New Delhi â€™ , emphasising the need to maintain the purity of the election process . 29 Having given our anxious consideration to the rival submissions which have been urged at the bar , we find that there are several reasons why it would be inappropriate for this Court to exercise its jurisdiction to interdict the declaration of results of the uncontested seats . First and foremost , it is necessary for the Court to notice that no specific relief was claimed before the High Court in regard to those seats where there was no contest . Neither were there adequate pleadings nor indeed were specific prayers set up before the 7 ( 1998 ) 1 SCC 405
