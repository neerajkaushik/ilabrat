in point of time was in the year 2006 which culminated in dismissal of writ petition in default . In the face of these facts , the order passed by the appellant holding 1 * respondent not to be entitled to any salary in respect of period of absence was correct and justified . The effect of the orders passed by the High Court , on the other hand , is that 1 â€œ respondent is to be paid salary for nearly 10 years when in reality she had actually worked for only 36 days during that period . She herself sought pre - mature voluntary retirement and was allowed to retire and was extended all retired benefits . 12 . Considering all these facts and circumstances , the orders passed by the Single Judge and the Division Bench in the present matter , in our view are unsustainable and erroneous . We therefore allow this appeal , set aside the Judgment and Order under appeal and dismiss Writ Petition No.30513 of 2011 . No costs . eeaewews wueee eta eaaies ween J.
