11 become functus officio and , therefore , had no jurisdiction to set aside the ex parte award and that the Central Government alone could set it aside , does not commend to . us . Sub - section ( 3 ) of Section 20 of the Act provides that the proceedings before the Tribunal would be deemed to continue till the date on which the award becomes enforceable under Section 17-A. Under Section 17-A of the Act , an award becomes enforceable on _ the expiry of 30 days from the date of its publication under Section 17 . The proceedings with regard to a reference under Section 10 of the Act are , therefore , not deemed to be concluded until the expiry of 30 days from the publication of the award . Till then the Tribunal retains jurisdiction over the dispute referred to it for adjudication and up to that date it has the power to entertain an application in connection with such dispute . That stage is not reached till the award becomes enforceable under Section 17-A. In the instant case , the Tribunal made the ex parte award on 9 - 12 - 1976 . That award was published by the Central Government in the Gazette of India dated 25 - 12 - 1976 . The application for setting aside the ex parte award was filed by Respondent 3 , acting on behalf of Respondents 5 to 17 on 19 - 1 - 1977 i.e. before the expiry of 30 days of its publication and was , therefore , rightly entertained by the Tribunal . It had jurisdiction to entertain it and decide it on merits . ‚Äù ( emphasis added ) From the above quotation it would appear that in Grindlays Bank the recall application was filed within thirty days from the date of publication of the award and hence , the objection raised on the basis of Section 17-A did not arise in this case . In Grindlays Bank this Court did not say that the Industrial Courts would have no jurisdiction to entertain an application for setting aside an award made after thirty days of its publication .
