14 High Court after considering the submission of the parties had made following observations:“On a perusal of the order dated 30.09.2008 it is difficult for this Court to accept the contention raised on behalf of the workman . It appears from the said order that the fTribunal had accepted the position that notice under Rule 21 of the said Rules had not been served upon the company before placing the case for ex - parte hearing . It has also accepted that Written Statement filed the workman had not been served upon them in accordance with provisions contained in Rules 20B(5 ) of the said Rules . On the face of such finding recorded by the Tribunal , it is absolutely clear that proceedings were conducted before it , leading to the impugned award , in clear violation of principles of natural as well as mandatory provisions of law . The award passed on 26.2.2008 is liable to be set aside only on this ground . ” 12 .
