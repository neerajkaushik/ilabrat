23 29 ) It is clear that the right which was given to the Deemed University to confer degrees pertain to those degrees which are specified by the UGC in the Official Gazette . Admittedly , BTC is not one of the degrees mentioned therein . The reason is obvious . Insofar as BTC is concerned , it is a Teachers Training Course which was regulated entirely and exclusively by NCTE Act and the Regulations framed therein . First thing which follows , therefore , is that mere conferment of Deemed University status did not entitle this University to give BTC degrees to its students . Having regard to the same , the judgments cited by Mr. Dwivedi will have no application to the present case . 30 ) This brings us to the provisions of NCTE Act and Regulations therein . A University was granted permission by the NCTE to start two years BTC Course vide letter dated August 16 , 2005 . However , this was subject to fulfillment of eight conditions mentioned therein . These conditions are summarised by the High Court , in the impugned judgment , which reads as under : â€œ Condition ' a ' required appointment of the faculty members and staff duly qualified as per the norms of NCTE / State Government / SCERT to be completed before the commencement of the course . It is not in dispute that at the relevant time SCERT was the examining body for the BTC course . Therefore , it was but necessary for the Post Graduate Degree College to have appointed qualified teachers and staff as per the SCERT norms read with NCTE norms . Under clause ' b ' countersigned statement of faculty members from the Director , SCERT was required to be submitted before the commencement of the academic session .
