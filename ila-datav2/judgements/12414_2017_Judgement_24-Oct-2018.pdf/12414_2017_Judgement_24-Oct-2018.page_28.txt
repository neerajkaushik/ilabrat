28 training of BTC Course under Government order dated January 15 , 2010 . As a corollary , it follows that there was no question of granting recognition to the private institutions upto January 15 , 2010 for BTC Course in the State of Uttar Pradesh . As this was the legal position prevailing , coupled with the fact that the Deemed University approached the NCTE / SCERT for recognition of BTC Course and is given the said recognition only from the year 2012 onwards , the admission of students in BTC Course for the Academic Sessions i.e. 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10 was not permissible and such degrees can not be treated as _ validly recognised . It may be harsh for the students who took admission in the Academic Sessions 2008 - 09 and 2009 - 10 . However , the Court can not countenance the position where the unrecognised course is given imprimatur of validity only on the ground of equity . Because of this reason itself , the High Court has awarded compensation to the students . Therefore , we find it difficult to agree to the submissions advanced by Mr. Parekh on behalf of the students as well . 36 ) In view of the aforesaid discussion , it is not possible to accede to the request of the Deemed University to waive the order of compensation made by the High Court . As a result , all these appeals are bereft of any merit and are accordingly dismissed .
