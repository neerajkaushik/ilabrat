22 “ Admissions shall be made on merit on the basis of marks obtained in the qualifying examination and/or in the entrance examination or any other selection process as per the policy of the State Government / UT Administration . ” 27 ) The argument on the basis of the aforesaid provision was that the admission had to be made not only on merits but ‘ as per the policy of the State Government / UT Administration ’ . Here , according to learned counsel , the Deemed University faltered and , therefore , can not seek any benefit . The counsel for the NCTE supported the aforesaid submissions put forth by the learned counsel for the State . 28 ) From the aforesaid arguments of the learned counsel for the appellants as well as Deemed University , it becomes clear that the entire case primarily rests upon the submission that after it became Deemed University by virtue of notification dated June 27 , 2008 issued by UGC under Section 3 of the UGC Act , Deemed University had right to hold examinations on its own as it became the ‘ examining body ’ for BTC Course . However , as noticed above , notification dated June 27 , 2008 granting status of Deemed University was subject to certain conditions . Section 22 of UGC Act gives right upon such Deemed University to confer degrees . However , sub - section ( 3 ) thereof defines the meaning of degree under that provision which reads as under : “ ( 3 ) For the purposes of this section , “ degree ’ means any such degree as may , with the previous approval of the Central Government , be specified in this behalf by the Commission by notification in the Official Gazette . ”
