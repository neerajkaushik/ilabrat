In this case , confirmation has been made and communicated on 27 " February 2013 and within fifteen days thereof ie . on 13 ° March 2018 , the amount of seventy - five percent had been deposited . Thereafter , sale certificate has been issued under Rule 9(6 ) . Rule 9(5 ) also makes it clear that in default of payment within the period mentioned in sub - rule 9(4 ) , the deposit shall be forfeited . There can not be any forfeiture of the amount of 25 percent in deposit until and unless the sale is confirmed by the secured creditor and there is a default of payment of 75 percent of the amount . The interpretation made by the High Court thus can not be accepted . 9 . If we read the provisions otherwise then we find even before the confirmation of sale within fifteen days , the amount would be forfeited by the authorised officer who may decide not to confirm the sale that would be a result not contemplated in Rule 9(2 ) , 9(4 ) and 9(5 ) which fortify our conclusion that it is only after the confirmation is made under Rule 9(4 ) that amount has to be deposited and on failure to deposit the amount , twenty - five percent amount has to be forfeited and property has to be resold . The provisions of Rule 9(6 ) also fortifies our conclusion , inasmuch as it is the expression used that on confirmation of sale by the secured creditor and “ if the term of payment has been complied with ” sale certificate is issued otherwise the forfeiture takes place , this compliance has to be only after the confirmation of sale and not before it . Thus , various provisions of Rule 9 makes it clear that interpretation made by Debts Recovery Tribunal and Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal and as affirmed by the High Court can not be said to be correct .
