property has to be resold . 8 . In order to comprehend the rival submissions , it is necessary to ponder as to intendment of Rule 9 of the 2002 Rules which deals with the time of sale , issues of sale certificate and delivery of possession , etc . Public notice of sale is to be published in the newspaper and only after thirty days thereafter , the sale of immovable property can take place . Under Rule 9(2 ) of the 2002 Rules , the sale is required to be confirmed in favour of the purchaser who has offered the highest sale price to the authorised officer and shall be subject to confirmation by the secured creditor . The proviso makes it clear that sale under the said Rule would be confirmed if the amount offered and the whole price is not less than the reserved price as specified in Rule 9(5 ) . It is apparent that Rule 9(1 ) does not deal with the confirmation by the authorised officer . It only provides confirmation by the secured creditor . Rule 9(3 ) makes it clear that on every sale of immovable property , the purchaser on the same day or not later than next working day , has to make a deposit of twentyfive percent of the amount of the sale price , which is inclusive of earnest money deposited if any . Rule 9(4 ) makes it clear that balance amount of the purchase price payable shall be paid by the purchaser to the authorized officer on or before the fifteenth day of " confirmation of sale of the immovable property " or such extended period as may be agreed upon in writing between the purchaser and the secured creditor . Thus , Rule 9(2 ) makes it clear that after confirmation by the secured creditor the amount has to be deposited . Rule 9(3 ) also makes it clear that period of fifteen days has to be computed from the date of confirmation .
