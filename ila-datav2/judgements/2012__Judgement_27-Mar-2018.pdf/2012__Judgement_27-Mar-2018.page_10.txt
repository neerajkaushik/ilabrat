nature , and couched in the negative , and leave no room for doubt . Proviso to Section 34 gives discretion to the court to condone the delay for a sufficient cause , but that discretion can not be extended beyond the period of thirty days , which is made exclusively clear by use of the words ‘ but not thereafter ’ . 15 . In Union of India v. Tecco Trichy Engineers and Contractors ( 2005 ) 4 SCC 239 , a three Judge Bench of this Court , in respect to the issue of limitation for filing application under Section 34 of the Act for setting aside the arbitral award , held that the period of limitation would commence only after a valid delivery of an arbitral award takes place under Section 31(5 ) of the Act . In para ( 8) , this Court held as under : " 8 . The delivery of an arbitral award under sub - section ( 5 ) of Section 31 is not a matter of mere formality . It is a matter of substance . It is only after the stage under Section 31 has passed that the stage of termination of arbitral proceedings within the meaning of Section 32 of the Act arises . The delivery of arbitral award to the party , to be effective , has to be “ received ” by the party . This delivery by the Arbitral Tribunal and receipt by the party of the award sets in motion several periods of limitation such as an application for correction and interpretation of an award within 30 days under Section 33(1 ) , an application for making an additional award under Section 33(4 ) and an application for setting aside an award under Section 34(3 ) and so on . As this delivery of the copy of award has the effect of conferring certain rights on the party as also bringing to an end the right to exercise those rights on expiry of the prescribed period of limitation which would be calculated from that date , the delivery of the copy of award by the Tribunal and the receipt thereof by each party constitutes an important stage in the arbitral proceedings .
