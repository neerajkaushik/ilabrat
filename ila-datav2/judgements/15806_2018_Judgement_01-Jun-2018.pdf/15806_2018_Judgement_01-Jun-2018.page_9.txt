He stated that if 70 per cent of the strength of residence had to be present in the hospital on 24.09.2017 ( i.e. the previous day of inspection ) , it is inconceivable that there could be shortage of 84 per cent teachers and 87 per cent of residents on the date of inspection . He also stated that a natural calamity like cyclone would result in increase in the number of patients . 8 . Mr. Ranjit Kumar , learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Respondent No.1 and 2 supported the judgment of the High Court .
