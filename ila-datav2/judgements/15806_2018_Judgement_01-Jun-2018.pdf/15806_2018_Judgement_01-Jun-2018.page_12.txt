should not be less than 50 per cent . This prescription of standards for availing an opportunity to seek re - inspection is not ultra vires either the Regulation or Section 10-A of the Act . 10 . On perusal of the material on record , we are of the opinion that the conclusion reached by the High Court regarding the manner in which inspection was conducted is also not correct . Bed occupancy at 45.30 per cent on random verification was the claim of Respondent No.1 and 2 . However , the inspection report shows that out of required minimum of 300 patients only 3 were available at 10.00 am on 25 " September , 2017 . This Court in Kalinga ( supra ) has held that medical education must be taken very seriously and when an expert body certifies that the facilities in a medical College are inadequate , it is not for the Courts to interfere with the assessment , except for very cogent jurisdictional reasons such as mala fides of the inspection team , ex facie perversity in the inspection , jurisdictional error on the part of the M.C.I. , etc . The submission relating to the cyclone being a reason for the number of patients being less is not acceptable . We are in agreement with the submission made on behalf of the Appellant that the Resident Doctors are required to be in the hospital at all points of time . 12
