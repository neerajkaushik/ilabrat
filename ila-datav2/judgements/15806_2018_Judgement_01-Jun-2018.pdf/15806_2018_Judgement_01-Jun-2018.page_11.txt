( 3 ) ( 1 ) ( a ) by the High Court is patently erroneous in as much as the High Court did not take note of the proviso to Regulation 8(3)(1 ) . Without a proper examination of the provision , the High Court fell in error in holding that Regulation 8 ( 8) ( 1 ) ( a ) would be applicable only to the Colleges seeking second renewal i.e. admissions of the third batch . Admissions upto the second renewal i.e. admissions to third batch would fall under Regulation 8 ( 8) ( 1 ) ( a ) . In other words , the proviso is not restricted only to second renewal cases . Even the first renewal is covered by proviso ( a ) to Regulation 8 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) as the language used is “ upto second renewal ” . We do not see any conflict between Section 10-A ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of the Act on one hand and Regulation 8 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) ( a ) on the other . Regulation 8 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) ( a ) is complementary to Section 10-A of the Act . Fixing minimum standards which have to be fulfilled for the purpose of enabling a medical College to seek fresh inspection would not be contrary to the scheme of Section 10-A. In fact , Regulation 8 ( 3 ) ( 1 ) provides that an opportunity shall be given to the medical College to rectify the defects . But , the proviso contemplates that certain minimum standards are to be satisfied i.e. there should not be deficiency of teaching faculty and/or residents more than 30 per cent and/or bed occupancy 11
