as per the said judgment is capable of being enhanced @ 10 per cent in the span of every three years . However , we are still within the window of three years . 15 . The result of the aforesaid is that after deducting 50 per cent of the amount towards personal expenses and adding 100 per cent towards future rise in income , we would be back at the figure of Rs.6,273 per month to which a multiplier of 18 has to be applied . The amount would come to Rs.13,54,968 . The amount under the conventional heads would be Rs.70,000 , i.e. , totaling to Rs.14,24,968 rounded off at Rs.14,25,000 . The award of interest would continue @ 12 per cent as awarded by the Tribunal . 16 . We may also notice the litigation of two decades , which the appellants have had to go through before different forums to claim the amounts due to them and we are of the view that they should be held entitled to costs throughout , which we assess at Rs.25,000 .
