Anr . ’ The High Court , considering that the claimants were the parents of the deceased , deducted 50 per cent towards personal expenses instead of 1/3 " of the amount , as per the Tribunal . In fact , a reading of the order shows that these were the only two pleas advanced on behalf of the insurance company on which the appeal of the insurance company succeeded . 7 . The High Court , however , fixed the multiplier at 18 instead of 16 as fixed by the Tribunal , as the deceased was aged about 25 years , and that would have been the appropriate multiplier as per Sarla Verma ’ . The High Court also examined the two other pleas made on behalf of the claimants , i.e. , that the award of Rs.15,000 for loss of estate and Rs.15,000 for loss of love and affection was inadequate . 8 . In view of what the High Court held as aforesaid , the amount was computed at Rs.10,72,360 with a sum of Rs.50,000 being awarded under the head of loss of estate as well as loss of love and affection instead of Rs.30,000 as awarded by the Tribunal and Rs.5,000 towards funeral expenses . The interest awarded was also upheld . 1 ( 2009 ) 6 SCC 121 2 supra
