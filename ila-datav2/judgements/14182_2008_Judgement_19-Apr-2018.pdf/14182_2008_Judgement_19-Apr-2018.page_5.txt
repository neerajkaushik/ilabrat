to give effect to the partition decree without a sketch map of the suit schedule property . At the time of passing the judgment and decree , the trial court should have made the said map as a part of the decree so that the partition could have been effected as per the said sketch . No party should be allowed to suffer for the error of the court . In the circumstances , the trial court has rightly made the plan a part of the decree for effecting partition . We are of the view that the High Court was not justified in setting aside the said order . 7 . Hence , this appeal is allowed . The order of the High Court impugned herein is set aside and the order of the trial court dated 06.09.2006 is restored . There will be no order as to costs . saS0R Wis Abies dea weNe aaa eee ARTS J.
