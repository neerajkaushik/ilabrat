decree . Judgment and decree be amended accordingly . ” 3 : The plaintiff challenged the said order before the High Court of Calcutta . The High Court by its order dated 05.02.2008 has allowed the revision and set aside the order dated 06.09.2006 of the trial court . During the pendency of these proceedings , both the plaintiff and the 1 “ defendant died and their LRs have been brought on record at different stages . The LRs of the 1 “ defendant and other defendants have filed this appeal challenging the order of the High Court . 4 . Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the appellants / defendants filed an application on 06.02.2001 praying that the suit may be partitioned in terms of the plan annexed to the application . However , by oversight the said plan was not exhibited . The plan demarcates the common area . The court had passed a decree by consent . Since the plan was not exhibited , difficulties arose for execution of the partition decree . Therefore , the court below has rightly allowed the application . The High Court on certain assumptions has set aside the said order . Learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents submits that three sketch maps have been produced at different stages in the suit . Therefore , the High Court has rightly directed the parties to file a joint petition indicating their intention regarding allotment of their property as per their shares by producing a sketch duly drawn by competent person . This order of the High Court does not call for interference .
