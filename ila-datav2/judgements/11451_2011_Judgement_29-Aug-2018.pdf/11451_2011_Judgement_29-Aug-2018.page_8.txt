Reorganization Act , 2000 , which has also been mentioned in the letter dated 3 September 2009 of the Government of India ; and iv ) The Guidelines dated 13September 2000 clearly envisage in respect of recruitment against vacancies , that wherever panels have been drawn but not published , they may be kept in abeyance till reorganization is given effect to . But these guidelines did not contemplate what action is to be taken in a situation where the selection has been made .
