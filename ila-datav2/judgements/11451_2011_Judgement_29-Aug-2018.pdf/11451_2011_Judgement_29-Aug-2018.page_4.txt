6 In the meantime , a challenge was made to the seniority list in the cadre of the appellants posted to the Uttarakhand secretariat by Respondents 1 to 5 , in Writ Petition no 1313 of 2005 filed before the Uttarakhand High Court . The challenge by Respondent 1 to 5 was only to the seniority list but not to the letter issued by the Central Government on 15 September 2004 permitting the transfer of employees with the consent of the reorganized state . The consent of the State of Uttar Pradesh granted by its letter dated 22 November 2005 relieving the appellants for transfer to the State of Uttarakhand was not subjected to challenge in the proceedings before the High Court . 7 The final allocation list published by the Central Government on 7 August 2009 excluded the appellants for transfer of services to the State of Uttarakhand as they were appointed after the cut - off date . The appellants preferred a representation to the Central Government requesting allocation of their services to the State of Uttarakhand . In response to the representation , a letter dated 3 September 2009 was communicated to the appellants denying them allocation to the State of Uttarakhand as they were appointed after 9 November 2000 . The letter stated that while they are not eligible for allocation under the U.P. Reorganisation Act , 2000 and neither the State Advisory Committee nor the Central Government has anything to do with the appellants , the State Governments of U.P. and Uttarakhand may take mutual action for resolving the issue .
