41 Uttarakhand . Under the Act , 9 November 2000 was the appointed day . During the initial days after its formation , the State of Uttarakhand was facing an acute shortage of officers in various departments including the Secretariat . The State of Uttarakhand was seeking help from the State of Uttar Pradesh and the Central Government to provide human resources . The Central Government , by its letter dated 15 September 2004 , permitted the transfer of employees on the basis of the mutual consent of both the States . The State of U.P. gave options to existing employees appointed before 9 November 2000 for transfer of their services to the State of Uttarakhand . However , despite those efforts , a number of vacancies continued in the newly formed State of Uttarakhand . Hence , various employees who were already employed with the State of U.P. prior to the appointed day were provided with a choice of permanent transfer of service to the State of Uttarakhand . In the meantime , in the case of persons such as the appellants where recruitments were completed but appointment letters were not issued the appointment letters indicated that their services may be allotted either to the State of Uttar Pradesh or the State of Uttarakhand after the appointed day . The services of the appellants were transferred and absorbed by the State of Uttarakhand with the mutual consent of both the states . Since then the appellants have been continuing as employees of the State of Uttarakhand .
