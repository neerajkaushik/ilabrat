12 20 ‘ There is no infirmity in the procedure adopted by both the states in the transfer of employees , on the basis of mutual consent . This was clearly contemplated by the letter dated 15 September 2014 of the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel , Public Grievances and Pensions . Hence , we are unable to agree with the view of High Court . 21 ‘ Accordingly , we allow the appeals and set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court . There shall be no order as to costs . [ INDIRA BANERJEE ] New Delhi August 29 , 2018
