Provided that where in respect of any such sum , tax has been deducted in any subsequent year , or has been deducted during the previous year but paid after the due date specified in sub - section ( 1 ) of section 139 , such sum shall be allowed as a deducted in computing the income of the previous year in which such tax has been paid . ” 24 ) Thus , the Finance Act , 2010 further relaxed the rigors of Section 40O(a)(ia ) of the IT Act to provide that all TDS made during the previous year can be deposited with the Government by the due date of filing the return of income . The idea was to allow additional time to the deductors to deposit the TDS so made . However , the Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill , 2010 expressly mentioned as follows : “ This amendment is proposed to take effect retrospectively from 1st April , 2010 and will , accordingly , apply in relation to the Assessment Year 2010 - 11 and subsequent years . ” 25 ) The controversy surrounding the above amendment was whether the amendment being curative in nature should be applied retrospectively i.e. , from the date of insertion of the provisions of Section 40(a)(ia ) or to be applicable from the date of enforcement . 21
