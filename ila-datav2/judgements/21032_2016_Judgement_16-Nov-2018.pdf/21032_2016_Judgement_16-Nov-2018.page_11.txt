11 7.1 At the outset , it is required to be noted that in the suit the original plaintiff sought the relief of declaration and permanent injunction only and there was no specific prayer of specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 . It is also required to be noted that even the original plaintiff submitted the application under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC to amend the plaint by seeking relief of specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 . However , the same came to be dismissed and the same has attained the finality . Even there was no specific issue framed by the learned trial Court for specific performance with respect to the agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 . Nothing is on record that , at any point of time , the original plaintiff made any grievance with respect to the non - framing of the issue with respect to specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 . Even no effort was made before the learned trial Court to re - frame the issue . Therefore , as such , there was no specific prayer for specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 . Despite the above , the first Appellate Court granted relief of specific performance of he agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 for which there was no prayer in the plaint . Therefore , the High Court was justified in reversing the judgment and order passed by the first Appellate Court granting relief for specific performance of the agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 . 7.2 Even the High Court is justified in not granting the other reliefs prayed in the suit , namely , the declaration that the original plaintiff is the owner and in possession of the suit property and even the suit for permanent injunction .
