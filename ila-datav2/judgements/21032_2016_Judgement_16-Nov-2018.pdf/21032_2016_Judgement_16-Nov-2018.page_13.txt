13 favour of the original defendant no.1 executed by the developers M / s Ansal Properties was in the year 1994 . Considering the evidence on record and even considering the case on behalf of the plaintiff , it appears that throughout the plaintiff was aware of the execution of the title deed / sale deed in favour of the original defendant no . 1 executed in the year 1994 , still the suit has been instituted in the year 2004 only , i.e. after a period of 10 years . Nothing is on record that any steps were taken by the original plaintiff to get the sale deed executed in his favour and/or in favour of his nominee . Therefore , the suit has been instituted after a period of 17 years after the execution of the agreement / agreement to sell dated 20.4.1987 and after a period of 10 years from the date of the title deed / sale deed in favour of the original defendant no . 1 . Considering the aforementioned facts and circumstances of the case , the plaintiff is not entitled such reliefs , except of decree of recovery of amount paid to the original defendant no . 1 . 7.4 In the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case , we are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned trial Court as well as that of the High Court , in not granting the other reliefs and granting the decree of recovery of the amount paid by the original plaintiff to the original defendant no . 1only . In view of the reasons stated above , we see no reason to interfere with the judgment and order passed by the High Court and , consequently , the present appeal deserves to be dismissed and is accordingly dismissed .
