18 . 19 . 20 . the gravity of offence alleged against the accused - respondents , the order of the High Court directing suspension of sentence and grant of bail is clearly unsustainable in law and the same is liable to be set aside . Accordingly the impugned order passed by the High Court is hereby set aside and the concerned authorities are directed to take the accused - respondents herein into custody forthwith . Lastly , the counsels for respondents in Appeals arising out of SLP ( Crl ) No.4816/2018 and SLP ( Crl ) No.4817/2018 have specifically pleaded that the respondents have already undergone a considerable period under incarceration . In light of the same , we request the High Court to expedite the hearings and dispose of the appeals accordingly . It is needless to observe that the observations made during the course of this order are only for deciding these appeals . The appeals stand allowed in aforesaid terms . As a sequel pending applications , if any shall also stand disposed of . 17
