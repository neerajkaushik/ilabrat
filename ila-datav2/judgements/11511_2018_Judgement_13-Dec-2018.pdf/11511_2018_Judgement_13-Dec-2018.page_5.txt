concerned under Section 156(3 ) of the Code in the event of the refusal of the police to act . Remedy was also available to the respondent by filing a complaint under Section 200 of the Code before the jurisdictional Magistrate . 10 . In view of the scheme of the Code as discussed , we have purposely refrained from going into the merits of the case so as not to prejudice either parties and also keeping in mind the nature of the jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code . Any application by respondent no.4 hitherto under the Code will therefore have to be considered by the appropriate authority or forum in accordance with law . For the reasons discussed , the impugned order is held to be unsustainable and is set aside . The First Information Report therefore also stands quashed for the reasons discussed , but with liberty as aforesaid . 11 . The appeal is allowed . SAUTE NAW dew saENENENIE TS J. [ R.F.
