a member of the Bar , the petitioner should know better than to question the conduct of a judicial proceeding before the High Court in a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution . This is yet another instance of reckless allegations being levelled against judges of the High Court in a proceeding where the correctness of the orders passed by the High Court is not in issue ; necessary parties to that proceeding are not before the court ; and though the legality of a judicial order can not be questioned in an original proceeding under Article 32 . 5 We would now deal with the relief which has been sought in terms of prayer ( a ) . The petitioner seeks the evolution of a “ set procedure ” for constituting Benches and allotment of cases to different Benches in this Court . Second , as part of the same prayer the petitioner seeks a Mandamus for the making of a rule , in the Rules of Procedure of this Court , to the effect that a three judge Bench in the Court of the Chief Justice should consist of the Chief Justice and the two senior - most judges while a Constitution Bench should consist of five senior - most judges ( or three ‘ senior - most ’ judges and two ‘ juniormost judges ) . Third , the petitioner seeks a bifurcation of this court into what he describes as a “ Supreme criminal court ” , with similar divisions to hear PIL , tax , service , land disputes and miscellaneous matters ( etc . ) .
