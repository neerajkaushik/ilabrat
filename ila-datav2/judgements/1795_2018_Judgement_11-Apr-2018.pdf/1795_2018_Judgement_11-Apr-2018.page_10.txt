10 of the Bench . We reiterate such an order can not be passed . It is not countenanced in law and not permissible . An institution has to function within certain parameters and that is why there are precedents , rules and conventions . As far as the composition of Benches is concerned , we accept the principles stated in Prakash Chand [ State of Rajasthan v.

In view of this binding elucidation of the authority of the Chief Justice of India , the relief which the petitioner seeks is manifestly misconceived . For one thing , it is a well settled principle that no mandamus can issue to direct a body or authority which is vested with a rule making power to make rules or to make them in a particular manner . The Supreme Court has been authorised under Article 145 to frame rules of procedure . A mandamus of the nature sought can not be issued . Similarly , the petitioner is not entitled to seek a direction that Benches of this Court should be constituted in a particular manner or , as he seeks , that there should be separate divisions of this Court .
