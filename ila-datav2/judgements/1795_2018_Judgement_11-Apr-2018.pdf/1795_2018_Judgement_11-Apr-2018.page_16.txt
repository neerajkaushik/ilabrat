16 16 Some of the averments which have been made by the petitioner are scandalous . However , we have considered it appropriate to allow the matter to rest with a caution that the petitioner must be more responsible for the manner in which he seeks to draft pleadings in future filings . 17 For the above reasons , we find no merit in the petition . The writ petition is , accordingly , dismissed . strecnceaememeaacomieammemenae CuI [ DIPAK MISRA ] anny J [ A M KHANWILKAR ] seeeviueesiutessutsssutsssuessseeesseeeen J [ Dr D Y CHANDRACHUD ] New Delhi ; April 11 , 2018 .
