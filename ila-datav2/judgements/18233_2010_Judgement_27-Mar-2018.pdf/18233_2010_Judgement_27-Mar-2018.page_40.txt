40 The argument is founded on the premise that there are certain statutory provisions and certain judgments of this Court which prescribe the prohibitory degrees for marriages and provide certain guidelines for maintaining the sex ratio and not giving any allowance for female foeticide that is a resultant effect of sex determination which is prohibited under the Pre - Conception and Pre - Natal Diagnostic Techniques ( Prohibition on Sex Selection ) Act , 1994 ( for short ‘ PCPNDT Act ’ ) ( Gee : Voluntary Health Association of Punjab v. Union of India and others'2 and Voluntary Health Association of Punjab v. Union of India and others ' ? ) . 46 . The first argument deserves to be rejected without much discussion . Suffice it to say , the same relates to the recognition of matrimonial status . If it is prohibited in law , law shall take note of it when the courts are approached . Similarly , PCPNDT Act is a complete code . That apart , the concern of this Court in spreading awareness to sustain sex ratio is not to go for sex determination and resultantly female foeticide . It has nothing to do with the institution of marriage . ” ( 2013 ) 4 SCC 1 8 ( 2016 ) 10 SCC 265
