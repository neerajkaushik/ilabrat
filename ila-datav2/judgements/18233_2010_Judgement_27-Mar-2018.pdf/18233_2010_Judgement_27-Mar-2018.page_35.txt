35 crime . It has to be clearly understood that honour crime is the genus and honour killing is the species , although a dangerous facet of it . However , it can be stated without any fear of contradiction that any kind of torture or torment or ill - treatment in the name of honour that tantamounts to atrophy of choice of an individual relating to love and marriage by any assembly , whatsoever nomenclature it assumes , is illegal and can not be allowed a moment of existence . 41 . What we have stated hereinabove , to explicate , is that the consent of the family or the community or the clan is not necessary once the two adult individuals agree to enter into a wedlock . Their consent has to be piously given primacy . If there is offence committed by one because of some penal law , that has to be decided as per law which is called determination of criminality . It does not recognize any space for informal institutions for delivery of justice . It is so since a polity governed by ‘ Rule of Law ’ only accepts determination of rights and violation thereof by the formal institutions set up for dealing with such situations . It has to be constantly borne in mind that rule of law as a concept is meant to have order in a society . It respects human rights .
