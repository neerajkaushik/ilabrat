that every restaurant shall have at least one emergency exit in addition to normal doorway fitted with doors which open outward in the event of occurrence of any fire hazard . Similarly , Clause 9 provides that how the Notice Board would be displayed and what will be its contents . 62 ) In our considered opinion , the conditions specified in Clauses 7 , 8 & 9 directly deal with the public safety , comforts , convenience , morality and law and order and we have not been able to find any kind of unreasonableness or arbitrariness in any of the abovementioned clauses so as to hold that they are unworkable for running the restaurant and to display the three performances . 63 ) In our view , those who find themselves unable to ensure compliances of these conditions or feel that it is not possible for them to comply , may not display the performances in their restaurants .    4 |
