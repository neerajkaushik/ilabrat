skill of an ordinary competent man exercising that particular art ” 19 . The aforesaid principle of law was reiterated and explained by Bingham L.J. in his speech in Eckersley vs. Binnie ( 1988 ) 18 Con LR 1 in the following words : “ From these general statements it follows that a professional man should command the corpus of knowledge which forms part of the professional equipment of the ordinary member of his profession . He should not lag behind other ordinary assiduous and intelligent members of his profession in the knowledge of new advances , discoveries and developments in his field . He should have such an awareness as an _ ordinarily competent practitioner would have of the deficiencies in his knowledge and _ the limitations on his skill . He should be alert to the hazards and risks in any professional task he undertakes to the extent that other ordinarily competent members of _ the profession would be alert . He must bring to any professional task he undertakes no less expertise , skill and care than other ordinarily competent members of his profession would bring , but need bring no more . The standard is that of the reasonable average . The law does not require of a professional man that he be a paragon combining the qualities of polymath and prophet . ” 12
