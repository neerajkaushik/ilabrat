13 . The knowledge requirement foisted on the appellants can not be that they ought to have deduced from circumstances that an offence has been committed . 14 . Accordingly , we are of the view that there is no evidence to implicate the appellants . Evidence should be such which should at least indicate grave suspicion . Mere likelihood of suspicion can not be the reason to charge a person for an offence . Accordingly , these appeals are allowed and the proceedings against the appellants in the aforesaid Sessions Case No . 460 of 2017 are hereby quashed . sesssusssuessueessuessuesssessaeessnessnesass J.
