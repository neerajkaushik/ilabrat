25 the material evidence regarding the charges other than murder has also been ignored . 25 . Thus , the High Court has failed to consider whether the Trial Court discarded material evidence in the form of eye - witness testimony on the issues of murder , attempt to murder and grievous hurt and completely overlooked evidence on other charges such as unlawful assembly and _ house - burning . Consequently , we find that the High Court has not given due consideration to the evidence on record to arrive at a reasoned conclusion and has thus failed to exercise its revisional jurisdiction in accordance with established principles . In our opinion , it would be appropriate for the High Court to undertake proper consideration of the material of the matter once again with due application of the judicial mind to find out as to whether the trial Court â€™s order has caused gross miscarriage of justice , manifest illegality or perversity . 26 . Before parting with the matter , we hasten to add that any observations made in this order will not influence the High Court in deciding the revision petition on merits . With these observations , the appeal is allowed , the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 30.06.2004 passed in C.R.R. No .
