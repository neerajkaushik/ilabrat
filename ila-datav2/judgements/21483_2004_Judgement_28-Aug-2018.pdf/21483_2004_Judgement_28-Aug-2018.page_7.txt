that the bar under Section 401(3 ) does not restrict the power of the Supreme Court under Article 136 of the Constitution . While concluding so , the following observations were made : “ 4 . Before we record our reading of the evidence produced in the case , let a legal submission advanced by Shri Lalit , appearing for the respondentaccused , be dealt with . His submission is that as the complainant had approached the High Court in revision and as under the revisional power available to the High Court under Section 401 CrPC , the High Court could not have altered the finding of acquittal into one of conviction , because of what has been stated in sub - section ( 3 ) thereof , if we were to be satisfied that the acquittal was wrongful , it would not be within our competence to convict the respondent ; at best the case could be sent back for retrial . We are not impressed with this submission inasmuch as the approach to this Court being under Article 136 of the Constitution . We do not read the limitation imposed by Section 401(3 ) of the Code qua the power available to us under the aforesaid provision . May it be pointed out that a similar submission had been advanced by Shri Lalit himself in the case of E.K. Chandrasenan v. State of Kerala [ ( 1995 ) 2 SCC 99 : 1995 SCC ( Cri ) 329 : JT ( 1995 ) 1 SC 496 ] , then contending that this Court is incompetent to issue rule of enhancement as had been done in those cases . It was held in the aforesaid decision that the power available to this Court under Article 136 is not circumscribed by any limitation . In any case , power under Article 142 is available to pass such order as may be deemed appropriate to do complete justice . We , therefore , reject this contention of Shri Lalit and proceed to examine the materials to find out whether case of conviction does exist , as the contention of the appellant . ”
