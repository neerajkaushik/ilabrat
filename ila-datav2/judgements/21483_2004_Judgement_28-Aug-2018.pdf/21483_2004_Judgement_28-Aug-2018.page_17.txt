17 grain of untruth or at any rate exaggeration , embroideries or embellishment . ( See Sohrab v. State of M.P. [ 1972 ) 3 SCC 751 : 1972 SCC ( Cri ) 819 ] and Ugar Ahir v. State of Bihar [ AIR 1965 SC 277 : ( 1965 ) 1 Cri LJ 256 ] . ) An attempt has to be made to , as noted above , in terms of felicitous metaphor , separate the grain from the chaff , truth from falsehood . ” 15 . It is not uncommon for witnesses to make exaggerations during the course of evidence . But merely because there are certain exaggerations , improvements and embellishments , the entire prosecution story should not be doubted . In Ranjit Singh v. State of Punjab , ( 2013 ) 16 SCC 752 , this Court observed : “ 26 . It is trite that even when exaggerations and embellishments are galore the courts can and indeed are expected to undertake a forensic exercise aimed at discovering the truth . The very fact that a large number of people were implicated in the incident in question who now stand acquitted by the High Court need not have deterred the High Court from appreciating the evidence on record and discarding what was not credible while accepting and relying upon what inspired confidence . That exercise was legitimate for otherwise the Court would be seen as abdicating and surrendering to distortions and/or embellishments whether made out of bitterness or any other reason including shoddy investigation by the agencies concerned . The ultimate quest for the court at all times remains “ discovery of the truth ” and unless the court is so disappointed with the difficulty besetting that exercise in a given case , as to make it impossible for it to pursue that object , it must make an endeavour in that direction . ”
