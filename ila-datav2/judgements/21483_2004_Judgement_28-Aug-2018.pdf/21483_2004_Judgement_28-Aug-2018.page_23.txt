23 jurisdiction can be exercised . The relevant observations of this Court are as under : “ 12 . The High Court was exercising the revisional jurisdiction at the instance of a private complainant and , therefore , it is necessary to notice the principles on which such _ revisional jurisdiction can be exercised . Sub - section ( 3 ) of Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure prohibits conversion of a finding of acquittal into one of conviction . Without making the categories exhaustive , revisional jurisdiction can be exercised by the High Court at the instance of a private complainant ( 1 ) where the trial court has wrongly shut out evidence which the prosecution wished to produce , ( 2 ) where the admissible evidence is wrongly brushed aside as inadmissible , ( 3 ) where the trial court has no jurisdiction to try the case and has still acquitted the accused , ( 4 ) where the material evidence has been overlooked either by the trial court or the appellate court or the order is passed by considering irrelevant evidence , and    ( 5 ) where the acquittal is based on _ the compounding of the offence which is invalid under the law . 13 . By now , it is well settled that the revisional jurisdiction , when invoked by a private complainant against an order of acquittal , can not be exercised lightly and that it can be exercised only in exceptional cases where the interest of public justice requires interference for correction of manifest illegality or the prevention of gross miscarriage of justice . In these cases , or cases of similar nature , retrial or rehearing of the appeal may be ordered . ”
