Therefore , the technical objection regarding sanction of post also fades into insignificance . Though we agree with the learned Additional Advocate General for the State that there was no sanction for the post , which was a statutory requirement , having regard to the peculiar facts of this case , we are of the view that the appellant should be deemed to be appointed as a regular Science Teacher , in view of the proposal made in 2003 for selection in the grade . Ordered accordingly . The appeal is , hence , allowed . 4 . The appellant shall be deemed to be a _ duly appointed teacher for all purposes . We make it clear that this Judgment is passed in the peculiar facts of this case and therefore , shall not be treated as a precedent . All consequential benefits arising out of the impugned Judgment shall be disbursed to _ the appellant within a period of three months from today . No costs . cee J.
