as to the non - payment of development charges and the decisions taken thereon . The State appears to have been sitting over the fence and watching its two key authorities under KTCP Act and KIAD Acct litigating . 27 . Section 14 read with Section 18 of the KTCP Act clearly connotes that the Planning Authority is entrusted with the function of granting licence to put up construction on the land including the land acquired and allotted by the Board under KIAD Act . This is also clear from the provisions contained in the non - obstante clause in Section 74-M of the KTCP Act which declares that the provisions of the said Act and the Rules , Regulations and Bye - Laws made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law . There is nothing in the provisions of this Act to exclude or exempt the lands which are covered by the KIAD Act . 28 . Inits lengthy judgment , the High Court inter alia observed that the very acquisition for the industrial areas and the development by KIADB by itself involve the change of land use and the development by the KIADB and while so , seeking permission for change of land use and its development under the KTCP Act will be superfluous . 20
