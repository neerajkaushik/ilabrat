above , prior to deletion of Section 10(20A ) , Section 10(20A ) was a provision which exempted the income of authority constituted in India by or under any law enacted for the purpose of planning , development ’ or improvement of cities , towns and villages or for both . There can not be any dispute that Urban Improvement Trust , i.e. the assessee was fully covered by _ the definition of authorities as contained in Section 10(20A ) prior to its deletion . When there is a specific deletion of Section 10(20A ) , the said deletion was for an object and _ purpose . The Explanatory Notes in Paragraph Nos . 13.1 to 13.4 as noticed above clearly mentioned that “ income of certain Housing Boards etc . to become taxable ” . The deletion of authorities , which were enumerated in Section 10(20A ) was a clear indicator that such authorities , which were enjoying exemption under Section 10(20A ) shall no longer be entitled to enjoy the exemption henceforth . The deletion of Section 10(20A ) thus has to be given a purpose and meaning . 34 . This Court in New Okhla Industrial Development Authority Vs . Chief Commissioner of Income Tax & Ors . ( supra ) , which was a judgment delivered by this very Bench had considered in detail the object and purpose of Section 10(20A ) , the object and purpose of Finance Act , 27
