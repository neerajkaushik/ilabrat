the recommendations of the 5 " Central Pay Commission and its acceptance . This was followed by a large number of representations from pensioners and resulted in the Government of India issuing an Office Memorandum on 17 " December , 1998 to the following effect : “ The President is now pleased to decide that w.e.f . 1.1.1996 , pension of all pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement shall not be less than 50 % of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay introduced w.e.f . 1.1.1996 of the post last held by the pensioner . ” 7 . It appears that the confusion continued and once again an Office Memorandum was issued by the Government of India on 11 " May , 2001 clarifying the earlier Office Memorandum . The clarification reads as follows : “ Tn the course of implementation of the above order , clarifications have been sought by Ministries / Departments of the “ post last held ” by the pensioner at the time of his / her superannuation . The second sentence on O.M. dated 17.12.1998 , i.e. “ pension of all pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement shall not be less than 50 % of the minimum pay in the revised scale of pay w.e.f . 1.1.1996 of the post last held by the pensioner ” , shall mean that pension of all pensioners irrespective of their date of retirement shall not be less than 50 % of the minimum of the corresponding scale as 01.01.96 , of the scale of pay held by the pensioner at the time of superannuation/ retirement . ” 8 . The grievance of the respondent is directed against the clarification dated 11 " May , 2001 since the respondent felt the impact of the clarification on his pension . He , therefore , preferred an Original Application before the Central Administrative Tribunal for his rightful C.A. No . of 2018 ( Arising out of S.L.P. ( C ) No . 5456 of 2018 ) Page 3 of 8
