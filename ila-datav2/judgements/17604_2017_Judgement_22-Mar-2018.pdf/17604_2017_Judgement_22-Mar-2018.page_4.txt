pension . The question raised by the respondent as indeed by some others was referred to a larger Bench of the Tribunal and the question referred reads as follows:“When , the pre - revised pay scale of Rs . 1400 - 2300 attached to the post of JE . Il ( TXR ) in the Railways was revised to Rs . 5000 - 8000 ( while the normal replacement pay scale for the pre - revised pay scale of Rs . 1400 - 2300 is Rs . 4500 - 7500 ) whether the pension admissible to the pre 01.01.1996 retirees should be based on the pay scale of Rs . 5000 - 8000 or should be restricted to that calculated on the basis of the pay scale of Rs . 4500 - 7000/- . ” 9 . By an elaborate judgment and order dated 31 “ October , 2011 the Tribunal took the view that the respondent held the post of Train Examiner on the date of his superannuation and his pension had been correctly fixed on that basis . The replacement scale for the post of Train Examiner was Rs . 4500 - 7000 with effect from 1 “ January , 1996 . It was held that the pension of the respondent could not be on par with the pay scale of a Junior Engineer Grade - II . The reference was answered accordingly . 10 . While coming to this conclusion the Tribunal adverted to 20 or more decisions rendered by various Benches of the Tribunal , several High Courts and also few decisions of this Court . This is an indication of the contest in store for pensioners when a claim for pension is made against the State . C.A. No . of 2018 ( Arising out of S.L.P. ( C ) No . 5456 of 2018 ) Page 4 of 8
