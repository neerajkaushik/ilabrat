2 11 . Be that as it may , the Tribunal eventually relied upon the decision of this Court in K.S. Krishnaswamy & Ors . v. Union of India & Anr . â€™ to dismiss the Original Application . 12 . Feeling aggrieved by the judgment and order of the Tribunal , the petitioner preferred W.P. No . 13207 of 2013 in the Madras High Court . By the impugned judgment and order dated 2 " August , 2016 the High Court allowed the writ petition and quashed the order passed by the Tribunal . It is under these circumstances that the Union of India is before us . 13 . We have heard learned counsel for parties and find that the Tribunal was right in relying upon the judgment and order passed by this Court in Krishnaswamy . In this decision , the very question that arose for consideration before the Tribunal and the High Court was dealt with , though with reference to some other posts of the Government of India . The question formulated by this Court in Krishnaswamy related to the scale of pay recommended by the 5 " Central Pay Commission and the acceptance of the recommendations by the Government of India by a policy decision dated 30 " September , 1997 and the Office Memorandum dated 17 " December , 1998 clarified by the Office Memorandum dated 11 " May , 2001 . The basic question that arose for consideration was whether the Office Memorandum dated 11 " May , 2001 overrides the ( 2006 ) 13 SCC 215 C.A. No . of 2018 ( Arising out of S.L.P. ( C ) No . 5456 of 2018 ) Page 5 of 8
