31 prospectively . This Court had directed that appropriate rules and methods will be adopted by the High Courts and approved by the States , wherever necessary by 31st March , 2003 . Upto 2004 , the quota for promotion on the basis of merit - cum - seniority was 75 per cent , the cadre strength as on 13.09.2007 was 89 , which was increased on 10.11.2007 as 107 . After the amendment of Rules on 15.01.2004 , promotion of 10 officers were made . It is mentioned in the Civil Appeal of the High Court that cadre strength of Punjab Superior Judicial Service before 2004 was 88 . Thus , in the year 2004 , when the cadre strength was 88 , 75 per cent posts were to be manned by promotees under merit - cum - seniority , i.e. 66 were to be manned by promotee officers . The judgment of this Court in All India Judges case ( supra ) being prospective , the ratio of officers as existing before unamended rules can not be adversely affected . A promotee before the amendment of Rules , 2004 , who was well within their quota , suddenly can not go out of their quota and become an excess merely on the strength of amendment of Rules , which are prospective in nature . For determining the quota , the cadre strength , which existed prior to amended rules and subsequent to the amended rules have to be treated differently . Promotees quota , which was 75 per cent prior to 2004 Rules makes 66 posts in their quota as before amendment
