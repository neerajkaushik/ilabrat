55 of the directions of this Court in Brij Mohan Lal â€™s case ( Supra ) taking these two Fast Track Court officers from Bar in the regular cadre can not be held faulty . They having been working as Additional District Judges in the Fast Track Court and they having been appointed in the regular cadre although in the same recruitment year , their placement above other direct recruits is justified . However , these two officers will be grouped along with direct recruits and shall occupy position number 1 and 2 in the direct recruits and others will follow thereafter . 64 . Now we come to the claim of Shri Arunvir Vashista Fast Track Court Judge who was selected by out of turn promotion . Shri Arunvir Vashista was appointed as Fast Track Court Judge consequent to promotion of fifteen officers under Rule 7(3 ) ( a ) . The appointment and selection committee along with proposing fifteen promotions under Rule 7(3)(a ) has also proposed seven officers to man the Fast Track Courts in which Shri Arunvir Vashista was included . Shri Arunvir Vashista thus occupied the Fast Track Court judge post in the year 2008 itself and participated in the limited departmental competitive examination and secured sixth position on merit . Among the out of turn promotees Shri Arunvir Vashista has been placed at sixth place .
