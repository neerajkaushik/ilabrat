61 in this judgment itself . We choose to adopt the second course for two reasons : a ) Already period of three years has elapsed when the tentative seniority list was published . Finalisation of seniority as early as possible is essential and necessary for administration of justice . b ) There is no dispute regarding inter - se - seniority of the promotees under Rule 7(3)(a ) and issue pertaining to inter - se - seniority of out of turn promotees and direct recruits have already been finalized by us . Only exercise which is to be undertaken is to place officers of three streams in accordance with the roster as indicated in Appendix - B. After placing the officers of three streams , the seniority position as per roster comes as follows :          S.NO . NAME RULE 1 .
