44 giving them unintended seniority over promotees who were already in position , would be dispensed with . This Court noticed office memorandum dated 07.02.1986 and observed that “ when direct recruits or promotees become available through later examinations or selections ” , it clearly mean that the situation contemplated is one where , there has been an earlier examination or selection , and is then followed by a " later " examination or selection . 52 . In the above context , this court laid down following in Paragraph 31.2 that “ it is not necessary , that the direct recruits of a particular recruitment year , should join within the recruitment year itself ” . It was held that date of joining would not be a relevant factor for determining seniority of direct recruits . In paragraph 31.2 and 34.1 following has been laid down : “ 31.2 . It is not necessary , that the direct recruits for vacancies of a particular recruitment year , should join within the recruitment year ( during which the vacancies had arisen ) itself . As such , the date of joining would not be a relevant factor for determining seniority of direct recruits . It would suffice if action has been initiated for direct recruit vacancies , within the recruitment year in which the vacancies had become available . This is so , because delay in administrative action , it was felt , could not deprive an individual of his due seniority . As such , initiation of action for recruitment within the recruitment year would be sufficient to assign seniority to the appointees concerned in terms of the “ rotation of quotas ” principle , so as to arrange them with other appointees ( from the alternative source ) ,
