14 who has changed his position to his detriment on the basis of the promise held out to him . This is not the position in the present cases . All the candidates are serving in the State Police or the Central Police Organisation or in the Army . Their position has not been adversely affected by the selection process and therefore , the principle of promissory estoppel is not applicable . 18 . The main attack against the decision of the Government is on the ground that the candidates had a legitimate expectation that pursuant to the written test and interview , their result would be declared and if found successful , they would be appointed . It is a well settled law that even if there is no vested right , the principle of legitimate expectation can be invoked . Legitimate expectation arises when the citizens expect that they will be benefitted under some policy or decision , announced by the State . At the same time , the law is well settled that the Legislature and the Executive can change any policy for good reasons . These good reasons must be such which are not arbitrary , which are not mala fide and the decision has been taken in the public interest . If the decision to change the policy is arbitrary or capricious then it may be struck down .
