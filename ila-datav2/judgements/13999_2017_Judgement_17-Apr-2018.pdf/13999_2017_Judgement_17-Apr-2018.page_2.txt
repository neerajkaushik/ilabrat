Competitive Examination ( for short ‘ the LCE ’ ) which took place from 20.05.2012 to 22.05.2012 , is legal and valid . 2 . The facts in brief are that keeping in view the shortage of police officials in the Indian Police Service , the Ministry of Home Affairs , Union of India set up a Committee headed by Shri Kamal Kumar , I.P.S. ( Retd . ) to make suggestions on various aspects including filling up the vacancies . The Committee , in its report , recommended that in addition to the normal modes of recruitment i.e. direct recruitment to the IPS through the annual Civil Services Examination and promotion from the State Police Services , a third method of Limited Competitive Examination should be introduced . The directly recruited Deputy Superintendents of Police in the State Police Service and their equivalents in the Central Police Services with a minimum of 5 years of service were eligible for this exam subject to a maximum age limit of 45 years . It was also recommended that not more than 65 officers should be recruited in a given year through the LCE and the recruitment through this channel may have to be staggered over a period of 7 years . The Government partially accepted the report and by amendment in sub - rule ( 1 ) of Rule 4 of the Indian Police Service ( Recruitment ) Rules , 1954 introduced a method of recruitment through LCE .
