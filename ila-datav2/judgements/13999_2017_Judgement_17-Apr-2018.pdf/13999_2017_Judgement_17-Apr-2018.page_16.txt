16 transferred to this Court are still to be heard . It was urged that the dispute stands decided by the Gauhati High Court and the Delhi High Court . It may be true that these two Courts have upheld the validity of the rules and the Union of India did not challenge the decisions in these two cases , but we can not lose sight of the fact that there are various other petitions pending and neither this Court nor the other High Courts are bound by the decision rendered by the Gauhati High Court or the Delhi High Court . These cases will have to be decided , if we are not to accept the stand of the Central Government . This could delay the matter even further . 21 . The officers , who may have been selected in the year 2013 at the upper age limit of 35 years or 36 years would now be 5 years older . No doubt , they are members of the State Police Service or the Central Police Organisation , but their induction or recruitment in the IPS is delayed by more than 5 years . When the Government laid down a policy that upper age limit was 35 years , it must have had some reason for fixing the upper age limit . That purpose is now defeated .
