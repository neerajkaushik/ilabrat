11 . no legal right to be appointed and mere selection does not give them such a right . 13 . Mr. Dushyant Dave , learned senior counsel , appearing for the persons who have appeared in the LCE , contended that even if there is no vested legal right , the said applicants have a legitimate expectation to be appointed . He concedes that in certain circumstances the Government can cancel a selection process but this cancellation can only be done when there is an overriding public interest . His submission is that the affidavit in question does not show any such overriding interest . Mr. R. Venkatramani , learned senior counsel appearing for some of the LCE candidates submitted that the Government must be fair and just and the affidavit fails to disclose what is the public interest or the higher purpose served by scrapping the examination . He further submits that the reasons given by the Government in its affidavit do not satisfy the test of overriding public interest or higher purpose and , as such , the decision of the Government to scrap the examination should not be accepted by this Court and the UPSC should be directed to declare the result and the Union of India be directed to make appointments pursuant to the result .
