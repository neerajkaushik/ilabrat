submitted by the CBI on 03.06.1996 in the matter could only be treated as an opinion expressed by the CBI which may be considered by the Government . Further , the Division Bench left it to the Government to consider or not to consider the opinion expressed by the CBI in its aforesaid report for the purpose of taking disciplinary action . 14 . The Division Bench also held that the Kerala Government 's decision of not taking action against the erring police officers of the SIT was based on three specific findings , namely ( i ) the Government 's examination of the case with reference to the views obtained from the State Police Chief with respect to the observations of the CBI alongwith the explanation of the erring police officers concerned , ( ii ) the absence of any direction by the Chief Judicial Magistrate who had accepted the final report , and ( iii ) absence of any direction from the Supreme Court to take action against the investigating officers . That apart , the Government opined that it is not proper or legal to take disciplinary action against the officers on the basis of CBI report after a lapse of fifteen years . 15 . Beit noted , the Division Bench concluded by observing thus : “ Therefore the three reasons mentioned in Ext . P2 clearly indicate that the Government has examined the relevant matters for arriving at the said decision . When a decision has been taken not to proceed further with any disciplinary action , after considering such _ relevant matters , the decision can not be considered as unreasonable , unfair or arbitrary . ”
