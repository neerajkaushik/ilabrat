25 31 . As stated earlier , the entire prosecution initiated by the State police was malicious and it has caused tremendous harassment and immeasurable anguish to the appellant . It is not a case where the accused is kept under custody and , eventually , after trial , he is found not guilty . The State police was dealing with an extremely sensitive case and after arresting the appellant and some others , the State , on its own , transferred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation . After comprehensive enquiry , the closure report was filed . An argument has been advanced by the learned counsel for the State of Kerala as well as by the other respondents that the fault should be found with the CBI but not with the State police , for it had transferred the case to the CBI . The said submission is to be noted only to be rejected . The criminal law was set in motion without any basis . It was initiated , if one is allowed to say , on some kind of fancy or notion . The liberty and dignity of the appellant which are basic to his human rights were jeopardized as he was taken into custody and , eventually , despite all the glory of the past , he was compelled to face cynical abhorrence . This situation invites the public law remedy for grant of compensation for violation of the fundamental right envisaged under Article 21 of the Constitution . In such a situation , it springs to life with immediacy . It is because life commands self - respect and dignity .
