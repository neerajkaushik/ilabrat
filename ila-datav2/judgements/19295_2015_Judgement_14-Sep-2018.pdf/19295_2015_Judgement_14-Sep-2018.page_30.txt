30 Singh v. State of Haryana and others ” , the three - Judge Bench , after referring to the earlier decisions , has opined : “ 38 . It is thus now well settled that the award of compensation against the State is an appropriate and effective remedy for redress of an established infringement of a fundamental right under Article 21 , by a public servant . The quantum of compensation will , however , depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case . Award of such compensation ( by way of public law remedy ) will not come in the way of the aggrieved person claiming additional compensation in a civil court , in the enforcement of the private law remedy in tort , nor come in the way of the criminal court ordering compensation under Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure . ” 38 . In Hardeep Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh ” , the Court was dealing with the issue of delayed trial and the humiliation faced by the appellant therein . A Division Bench of the High Court in intra - court appeal had granted compensation of Rs . 70,000/- . This Court , while dealing with the quantum of compensation , highlighted the suffering and humiliation caused to the appellant and enhanced the compensation . 39 . In the instant case , keeping in view the report of the CBI and the judgment rendered by this Court in K. Chandrasekhar ( supra ) , suitable compensation has to be awarded , without any trace of doubt , to compensate the suffering , anxiety and the treatment by which the quintessence of life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution withers away . We think it appropriate to direct the State of Kerala to pay 10 ( 2006 ) 3 SCC 178 11 ( 2012 ) 1 SCC 748
