32 . 26 There has been some argument that there has been no complaint with regard to custodial torture . When such an argument is advanced , the concept of torture is viewed from a narrow perspective . What really matters is what has been stated in D.K. Basu v. State of W.B. ’ . Court in the said case , while dealing with the aspect of torture , held : “ 10 . ‘ Torture ’ has not been defined in the Constitution or in other penal laws . ‘ Torture ’ of a human being by another human being is essentially an instrument to impose the will of the ‘ strong ’ over the ‘ weak ’ by suffering . The word torture today has become synonymous with the darker side of human civilisation . ‘ Torture is a wound in the soul so painful that sometimes you can almost touch it , but it is also so intangible that there is no way to heal it . Torture is anguish squeezing in your chest , cold as ice and heavy as a stone , paralysing as sleep and dark as the abyss . Torture is despair and fear and rage and hate . It is a desire to kill and destroy including yourself . ’ — Adriana P. Bartow 11 . No violation of any one of the human rights has been the subject of so many conventions and declarations as ‘ torture ’ — all aiming at total banning of it in all forms , but in spite of the commitments made to eliminate torture , the fact remains that torture is more widespread now than ever before . ‘ Custodial torture ’ is a naked violation of human dignity and degradation which destroys , to a very large extent , the individual personality . It is a calculated assault on human dignity and whenever human dignity is wounded , civilisation takes a step backward — flag of humanity must on each such occasion fly half - mast . 4 ( 1997 ) 1 SCC 416 The
