10 to the following effect : “ 13 6 The High Court issued these consequential directions : HEE the decree for specific performance of contract in question is found incapable of being executed due to acquisition of subject land , the decree shall stand suitably substituted by a decree for realisation of compensation payable in lieu thereof as may be or have been determined under the relevant Act and the plaintiff shall have a right to recover such compensation together with solatium and interest due thereon . The plaintiff shall have a right to recover it from the defendant if the defendant has already realised these amounts and in that event the defendant shall be further liable to Pay interest at the rate of 12 per cent from the date of realisation by him to the date of payment on the entire amount realised in respect of the disputed land . ” 13 . In the above context , this Court proceeded to examine the ambit and scope of Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act . This Court came to the opinion that when the contract has become impossible with no fault of the plaintiff , Section 21 enables the Court to award compensation in lieu of the specific performance .
