Paragraphs 24 , 29 and 30 are extracted below : “ 24 . When the plaintiff by his option has made specific performance impossible , Section 21 does not entitle him to seek damages . That position is common to both Section 2 of Lord Cairn ’s Act , 1858 and Section 21 of the Specific Relief Act , 1963 . But in Indian law where ’ the contract , for no fault of the plaintiff , becomes impossible of performance Section 21 enables award of compensation in lieu and substitution of specific performance . 29 . In the present case there is no difficulty in assessing the quantum of the compensation . That is ascertainable with reference to the determination of the market value in the land acquisition proceedings . The compensation awarded may safely be taken to be the measure of damages subject , of course , to the deduction therefrom of money value of the services , time and energy expended by the appellant in pursuing the claims of compensation and the expenditure incurred by him in the litigation culminating in the award . 30 . We accordingly confirm the finding of the High Court that respondent was willing and ready to perform the contract and that it was the appellant who was in breach . However , in substitution of the decree for specific performance , we make a decree for compensation , equivalent to the amount of the land acquisition compensation awarded for the suit lands together with solatium and accrued interest , less a sum of Rs 1,50,000 ( one lakh fifty thousand only ) 11
