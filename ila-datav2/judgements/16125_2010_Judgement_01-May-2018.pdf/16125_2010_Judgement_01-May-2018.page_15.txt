because by the time A.P. Land Reforms ( Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings ) Act , 1973 ( Act 1 of 1973 ) and the Urban Land ( Ceilings and Regulation ) Act , 1976 , came into force Mir Fazeelath Hussain Khan , who originally filed the application before the 3 " respondent , was alive , and had filed a declaration under the Act 1 of 1973 . He showed the total area covered by S. Nos . 1009 , 1043 to 1065 belonging to him as Acs.1109 - 92 gts . That extent was deleted from his holding as it was acquired and by the order dated 09 - 12 - 1976 , vide common order in C.C.Nos.156 to 159 / W/75 he was held to be holding 0.4083 standard holding in excess even after deleting of an extent of Acs.1109.92 gts in S. Nos . 1009 , 1043 to 1065 of Kukatpally village . If Mir Fazeelath Hussain Khan really was in possession of or was owning any extent over and above the area acquired by the petitioner either in S. No . 1009 or 1043 to 1065 , he would have had to surrender that area also , because even without that area being included in his holding he was found to be holding land in excess of the ceiling area . ” “ So , it is clear that the family of Raisyar Jung was said to be holding only land to the extent of Acs.349 - 63 cents in S.No.1007 but not any land in S. No . 1009 . This extent of Acs.11 - 10 gts now said to be in the possession of unofficial respondents was not declared by them or their predecessors in the declaration under Act 1 of 1973 . Had Fazeelath Hussain Khan , who filed the petition before the District Revenue Officer , or any of the unofficial respondents or their predecessors - in - title , been in possession of any extent of land in S. No . 1009 by 01.01.1975 they would have shown it in their declaration filed under Act 1 of 1973 . But they did not do so . For that reason also the contention of the unofficial respondents that they are in possession of some land in S. No . 1009 and that the extent of S. No . 1009 is more than that was acquired by the petitioner can not be believed or accepted . ” 34 . The learned Single Judge also dealt with the submission on behalf of the respondents that the APHB had no locus standi to question the order passed by the Commissioner ( Appeals ) . It was noted that the APHB was a party to the proceedings before the Commissioner ( Appeals ) C.A. Nos . /2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos . 21856 - 21862 of 2010 ) Page 15 of 31
