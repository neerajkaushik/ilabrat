This clause is sought to be relied upon by the respondents . It must be appreciated in this case that there is no question of a calculation error since no arithmetical error was committed as understood by this Court . The area of Survey No.1009 was measured and it was found to be 666.25 acres ( including the area acquired for Manjeera Water Works Department ) . The survey by the Measuring Circle Inspector , the check by the G.D. Inspector and approved by the Land Record Assistant clearly indicate this . This was sought to be ‘ corrected ’ by the respondents by claiming that the area of Survey No.1009 was much more . A calculation error would be , in a situation such as the present , an error that would appear on the face of the document or the revenue records , as the case may be . If there is a need to carry out a survey and a re - survey , the error can not by any means , be described as a clerical error . 53 . What makes the situation worse insofar as the respondents are concerned is that according to them the error was to the extent of 11.10 acres but on a survey having been conducted , the error was said to be to an extent of 20.18 acres . Surely , such a discrepancy can not be described as an accidental slip or a clerical mistake or a calculation error . It can only be described as a major error which ought to have been rectified at the appropriate time in 1968 when the Award was passed or soon thereafter . To notice and make much ado about such an error after at C.A. Nos . /2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos . 21856 - 21862 of 2010 ) Page 23 of 31
