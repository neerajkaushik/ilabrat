was that the area of Survey No.1009 was not 661.04 acres or 666.25 acres but actually 687.03 acres then the contention is self - defeating . This is because the area of Survey No.1009 would then have to be read as 687.03 for all purposes and not 661.04 acres . The consequence of this correction would be that the acquisition was of 687.03 acres and not of 661.04 acres . 48 . That apart , the correction of the alleged clerical error does not give rise to the argument that only 661.04 acres was acquired out of 687.03 acres . If the correction gives rise to an argument or contention , then it ceases to be the correction of a clerical error but is really the correction of a substantive error , which does not come within the purview of Section 87 of the Act . 49 . Be that as it may , in M / s Tata Consulting Engineers v. Workmen ! Pathak , J. adverted to a clerical error and held in paragraph 20 of the Report as follows : “ The jurisdiction given to the [ Industrial ] Tribunal by Rule 31 [ Industrial Disputes ( Bombay ) Rules , 1957 ] is closely circumscribed . It is only a clerical mistake or error which can be corrected , and the clerical mistake or error must arise from an accidental slip or omission in the award . An accidental slip or omission implies that something was intended and contrary to that intention what should not have been included has been included or what should have been included has been omitted . It must be a mistake or error amenable to clerical correction only . It must not be a mistake or error which calls for rectification by modification of the conscious adjudication on the issues involved . ” 11980 ( Supp . ) SCC 627 C.A.
