Because , even when there is no period of limitation prescribed for exercise of such powers , the intervening delay , may have led to creation of third - party rights , that can not be trampled by a belated exercise of a discretionary power especially when no cogent explanation for the delay is in sight . Rule of law it is said must run closely with the rule of life . Even in cases where the orders sought to be revised are fraudulent , the exercise of power must be within a reasonable period of the discovery of fraud . Simply describing an act or transaction to be fraudulent will not extend the time for its correction to infinity ; for otherwise the exercise of revisional power would itself be tantamount to a fraud upon the statute that vests such power in an authority . ” 61 . Finally in Basanti Prasad v. Chairman , Bihar School Examination Board ' ® it was pointed out where third party rights are likely to be affected , the courts decline to interfere but if there is a necessity to interfere then the aggrieved person should be heard on merits . 62 . Insofar as the facts of the present case are concerned , the claim made under Section 87 of the Act was after a period of at least 25 years . This can hardly be described as a reasonable period . There is no explanation for the inordinate delay and to make matters worse , third party interests have been created through a Housing Scheme developed on the land in dispute or in any event on the surrounding land . After a further lapse of 25 years it is not possible to put the clock back , even if there is any reason to do so , which reason we can not even visualise in this case . 10(2009 ) 6 SCC 791 C.A.
