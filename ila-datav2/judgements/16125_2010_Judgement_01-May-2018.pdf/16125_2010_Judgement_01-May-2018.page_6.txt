The aforesaid officer shall hear all applications made within two years after the introduction of the settlement , for the correction of any wrong entry of a pattadar ’s name in the register referred to in the preceding section and if satisfied about the error whether such error has been made through negligence , fraud , or collusion shall correct the same , notwithstanding that the party concerned does not admit the error but no such application shall be entertained after two years , unless reasonable cause is shown to the said officer for the delay , and in such cases if any error is proved it shall not be corrected without obtaining the sanction of the Government . ” 13 . Acting on the application , the District Collector requested the Assistant Director , Survey and Land Records for a survey of Survey No . 1009 and to fix the boundaries . The Assistant Director issued notice to the APHB on 7 " July , 1994 for the purposes of carrying out the survey but according to the APHB the notice was not received . In our opinion , the non - receipt of the notice is hardly of any relevance . 14 . In any event , the Assistant Director submitted a Report on 5 " August , 1994 to the District Collector . In his Report , it was concluded that the area of Survey No . 1009 was actually 687.03 acres . This comprised of 661.04 acres ( subject matter of consideration before us ) and 5.21 acres earlier acquired for Manjeera Water Works Department . Therefore , according to the Assistant Director there was an excess of 20.18 acres that had not been acquired . It was also noted that IDL was in possession of some extent of Survey No . 1009 . No specification or details were provided of the area and location of the land in possession of IDL . C.A. Nos . /2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos . 21856 - 21862 of 2010 ) Page 6 of 31
