applicable . The learned Single Judge made a reference to the failure of the State and the respondents to produce the record prepared at the time of survey which could have shown a wrong calculation of area . In this regard it was held by the learned Single Judge as follows : “ Record prepared at the time of survey is not produced to show that there is a wrong calculation of area , though the measurement on ground and record support the correct area . So , entry regarding extent of S.No.1009 can not be said to have been made wrongly due to a clerical mistake . By arriving at the area of a particular survey number by conducting survey thereof only , several decades after settlement , and without surveying the areas in other survey numbers adjacent to that survey number , question of the original entry in the settlement register was a wrong entry as a clerical error or not can not be determined . There is nothing on record to show that lands in adjacent survey numbers of S.No.1009 also were surveyed and as to what is the extent found in such survey , and the extent noted in the settlement register . ” 33 . With regard to the contention that only 661.04 acres had been acquired out of Survey No.1009 , the learned Single Judge noted that a declaration had been filed by and on behalf of the respondents under the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms ( Ceiling of Agricultural Holdings ) Act , 1973 . In that declaration there was nothing to suggest that the respondents were holding excess land which would have been so had the respondents been in possession of 11.10 acres . The learned Single Judge observed as follows : “ The contention of Mir Fazeelath Hussain Khan and his heirs that since they are in actual physical possession of the land of Acs.11=10gts in S. No . 1009 , even after acquisition by the petitioner , and so they can make a claim can not be countenanced C.A. Nos . /2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos . 21856 - 21862 of 2010 ) Page 14 of 31
