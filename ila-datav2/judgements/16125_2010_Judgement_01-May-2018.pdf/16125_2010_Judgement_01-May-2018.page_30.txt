acquired . This is certainly not so and the entire Survey No.1009 was acquired . The submission in this regard is rejected . 67 . We also hold that the claim made by the respondents under Section 87 of the Act was hopelessly delayed for which there is absolutely no explanation forthcoming . In addition , we hold that since third party rights have been created in the meanwhile under the Housing Scheme of the APHB and there is no way to put the clock back . The respondents ought to have been vigilant in pursuing their claim , assuming the claim was legitimate , but since they were not vigilant enough , they must suffer the consequences of their inaction . 68 . We also hold that the proceedings under the Andhra Pradesh Land Reforms ( Ceiling of Agricultural Holdings ) Act , 1973 were of some consequence but since the APHB has not relied upon the proceedings under the said Act and learned counsel has only mentioned it in passing , we do not intend to base our decision on the declaration made by the respondents under the said Act . 69 . We also hold that the APHB was directly and primarily affected by the claim made by the respondents under Section 87 of the Act and therefore had the locus standi to proceed before the Commissioner ( Appeals ) , the High Court and this Court . 70 . In view of the above conclusions , the judgment and order passed C.A. Nos . /2018 ( @ SLP ( C ) Nos . 21856 - 21862 of 2010 ) Page 30 of 31
