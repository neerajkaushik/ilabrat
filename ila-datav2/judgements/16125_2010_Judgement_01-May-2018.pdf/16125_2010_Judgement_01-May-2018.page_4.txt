petition it was stated that survey nos . 1009 and 1043 to 1065 comprise of 1121.17 acres . However , compensation was awarded only for 1104.26 acres ( 5.21 acres relating to Manjeera Water Works Department was not included in this calculation ) . Accordingly , it was stated that “ 11 acres and odd , they being the property of the claimant , it is not acquired and they remain to be the property of the claimant . ” It is significant to note that the 11 acres and odd which was sought to be excluded from the acquisition proceedings by the respondents was not specified or identified inasmuch as the survey number of this un - acquired area was not stated or earmarked by the claimants . It is much later that the respondents came to the conclusion that the allegedly un - acquired 11 acres and odd was a part of Survey No . 1009 . 11 . Be that as it may , the compensation was enhanced and ultimately , settled by this Court sometime in 1992 . We are not concerned with the details of the compensation proceedings any further but have mentioned it only for the purpose of indicating that : i ) The entire area of survey nos . 1009 and 1043 to 1065 was acquired . The acquisition consisted of huge areas and physical measurements were carried out , surveyed , checked and approved as per the revenue records . C.A.
