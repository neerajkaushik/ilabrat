that the revenue authorities had come a factual conclusion in their favour and the High Court ought not to have interfered with the factual conclusions and even this Court ought not to interfere with the factual conclusions arrived at by the revenue authorities . In our opinion , the revenue authorities had completely misdirected in law in reopening a factual issue that had been settled way back in 1968 if not earlier and there was no occasion for reopening that factual issue after a lapse of at least 25 years . That being the position , it can not be said that the courts are precluded from interfering in a matter of determination of facts when the authorities have completely misdirected themselves in law and exercised jurisdiction which did not vest in them . We therefore also reject this submission of the respondents . Conclusion 65 . To conclude , therefore , we hold that the entire Survey No . 1009 was acquired by the APHB for a Housing Scheme . No parcel of land in Survey No.1009 was left out or not acquired . Compensation was paid for acquisition of the entire Survey No.1009 . The Division Bench of the High Court erred in concluding that 20.18 acres of land in Survey No.1009 had not been acquired . 66 . We also hold that it is too simplistic on the part of the respondents to contend that land in excess of 661.04 acres in Survey No.1009 was not C.A.
