18 . The other private respondents contended that even they were parties to the objections filed by Alok Mitra . We can not agree for the simple reason that the objections were signed only by R.K.Pandey , advocate and the vakalatnama given to him was signed only by Alok Mitra . None of the other private respondents signed the vakalatnama in favour of R.K.Pandey . On the contrary , when the other private respondents objected to the withdrawal of the objections by Alok Mitra , they categorically stated that they had not given a power of attorney to Alok Mitra . In that view of the matter , it can hardly lie in the mouth of these private respondents to contend that the objections filed by Alok Mitra were also filed on their behalf . The private respondents other than Alok Mitra have come out with an unbelievable story only to somehow or other keep the issue alive through litigation and unfortunately , they have been successful in doing so for the last more than one decade . 19 . We also find that the conduct of all the private respondents is a clear indication of their acceptance of the validity of the auction sale . It has come on record that the auction sale resulted in a sale price which was over and above the dues and liabilities of the private respondents by an amount of about Rs . 14 lakhs . Through applications filed by the private respondents on 11 ‚Äù January , 2005 and 25 " January , 2005 requests were made for being given back the excess amount raised by the auction C.A. Nos . 9836 OF 2014 etc . etc . Page 7 of 9
