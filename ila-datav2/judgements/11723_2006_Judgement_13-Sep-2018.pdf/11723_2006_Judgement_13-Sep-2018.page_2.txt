It appears that the businesses were not successful and they fell in debt being unable to pay the workmen or even pay closure compensation . 4 .

Since the amounts were not paid despite a citation and recovery certificates , the property / vacant land of the private respondents being 1877.88 sq . yards in Plot No.4-A/4(1A / A ) Hashimpur Road , Allahabad was attached . 5 . Subsequently , the property / vacant land was put to auction which took place on 17 " November , 2004 . One of the appellants Pravesh Kumar Sachdeva ( for short Sachdeva ) was the highest bidder having given a bid of Rs . 70 lakhs . 6 .
