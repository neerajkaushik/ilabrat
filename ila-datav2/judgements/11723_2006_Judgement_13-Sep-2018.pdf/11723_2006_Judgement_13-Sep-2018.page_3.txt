proves to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he has sustained substantial injury by reason of such irregularity or mistake . ( ii ) * * * ( iii ) The order of the Commissioner passed under this rule shall be final . ‚Äù 7 . One of the private respondents ( Alok Mitra ) filed an application / objections on 16 " December , 2004 . The cause title of the application / objections mentioned the name of all the private respondents that is , Alok Mitra , Ashok Mitra , Deepak Mitra , Manmohan Mitra and Madhurima Ghosh . However , on a perusal of the application / objections placed before us in original , we found that it was signed only by the advocate R.K. Pandey . The vakalatnama given to the advocate was signed only by Alok Mitra . One of the issues raised before us was whether the application / objections were filed by Alok Mitra or by all the private respondents . 8 . Be that as it may , in our opinion , the application / objections were filed only by Alok Mitra and by none of the other private respondents even though their names find mention in the cause title of the document . We say this because the vakalatnama was given in favour of the advocate only by Alok Mitra and there is nothing to indicate that he had given the vakalatnama as the attorney or representative of the other private respondents .
