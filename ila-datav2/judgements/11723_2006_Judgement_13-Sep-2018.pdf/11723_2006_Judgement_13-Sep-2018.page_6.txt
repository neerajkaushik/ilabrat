on their behalf . The two paragraphs quoted above confirm that the application / objections of 16 Â° December , 2004 were not filed by the private respondents . 15 . Unfortunately , by an order dated 21 * November , 2005 the application filed by the private respondents ( other than Alok Mitra ) was allowed by the Competent Authority and the confirmation of sale in favour of Sachdeva was set aside . This led Sachdeva to file a writ petition ! in the Allahabad High Court , which came to be dismissed by the impugned judgement and order dated 23 " March , 2006 . This resulted in Sachdeva and the vendee , Pawan Kumar Agarwal to prefer the present appeals in this Court . 16 . As mentioned above , on these facts , the only question for our consideration is whether the High Court was in error in setting aside the confirmed auction sale . 17 . It is quite clear from the narration of facts that the objections raised to the auction sale were only by Alok Mitra , who did not communicate the objections to the District Magistrate in time . No other objection was raised to the auction sale and it was duly confirmed by the District Magistrate . Alok Mitra later withdrew his objections . 1 Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No . 76863 of 2005 C.A. Nos . 9836 OF 2014 etc . etc . Page 6 of 9
