12 . Onor about 1 * April , 2005 Sachdeva got the subject land converted to freehold and a little later in May 2005 , he sold a part of it to Pawan Kumar Agarwal ( also an appellant ) . 13 . After the aforesaid transaction , an application was filed by the private respondents other than Alok Mitra before the Competent Authority on 19 " May , 2005 in which a prayer was made to recall the order of 24 " January , 2005 permitting withdrawal of the application / objections filed by Alok Mitra . The averments made in the application in paragraphs 3 and 4 are significant and read as follows : “ 3 . That the applicants had never given a power of attorney to the opposite party No . 6 Alok Mitra to act for them and on their behalf , and were also not ratified the act and action taken by said Sri Alok Mitra . 4 . That the applicants never asked , directed and consented with Sri Alok Mitra opposite party No . 6 not to press or to withdraw the aforesaid objection / application No.5 of 2004 . ” 14 . A reading of the aforesaid two paragraphs indicates an inherent self - contradiction . While it is stated in paragraph 3 that the applicants had not given any power of attorney to Alok Mitra to act for them and on their behalf whereas in paragraph 4 they say that they had not asked , directed and consented to the withdrawal of the objections / application filed by Alok Mitra . The inherent contradiction is that if they had not authorized Alok Mitra to file an application , there can not be any question of their authorizing Alok Mitra to withdraw the application since it was not filed C.A. Nos . 9836 OF 2014 etc . etc . Page 5 of 9
