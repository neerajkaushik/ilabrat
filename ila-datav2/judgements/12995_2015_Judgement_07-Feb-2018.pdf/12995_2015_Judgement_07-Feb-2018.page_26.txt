been given under duress and coercion , we are of the opinion that there is nothing on record to prove that the said Certificate had been given under duress or coercion and as the Certificate itself provided a clearance of no dues , the contractee could not now turn around and say that any further payment was still due on account of the losses incurred during the execution of the Contract . The story about duress was an afterthought in the background that the losses incurred during the execution of the Contract were not visualised earlier by the contractee . As to financial duress or coercion , nothing of this kind is established prima facie . Mere allegation that no - claim certificates have been obtained under financial duress and coercion , without there being anything more to suggest that , does not lead to an arbitrable dispute . The conduct of the contractee clearly shows that “ no - claim certificate ” was given by it voluntarily ; the contractee accepted the amount voluntarily and the contract was discharged voluntarily . Conclusion :
