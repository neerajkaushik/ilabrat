Secondly , the Revenue Officer was held to have no jurisdiction to go into the question as to whether the recorded owner is the benamidar for any other person . 8 . On the other hand , on the demise of Jitendra Lal Paul , the land vested with his widow , Kusumbala Paul , who sold it to Mr. Rathindra Chandra Hore . The appellant , Ashim Ranjan Das , purchased the said land measuring 8.26 acres in 1987 from Mr. Rathindra Chandra Hore , which was originally held by late Jitendra Lal Paul . 9 . It appears that since only Golap Bala Saha Mondal had filed the earlier writ petition , the State Government took steps qua the land of Jitendra Lal Paul on the premise that the land vested in the State Government and executed Deeds of Ryoti Settlement with regards to the land in favour of respondents No . 1 and 2 herein . The first two respondents before us are therefore the patta holders of the land through registered pattas of July , 1980 . That is how the title came to Civil Appeal No.3932/2009 Page 8 of 15
