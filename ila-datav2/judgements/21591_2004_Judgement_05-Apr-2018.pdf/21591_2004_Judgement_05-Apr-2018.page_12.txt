We may add here that the rights of the appellant are derived from Jitendra Lal Paul for which the writ petition was filed only in the year 1990 . It appears that in the interregnum period the land was transferred to respondent Nos.1 & 2 . It was also contended by the appellant that the first two respondents could not complain or make a grievance for not being made parties in Appeal No.401/2000 since the issue of the proceedings under Section 44(2a ) of the Acquisition Act already stood resolved and had attained finality . 16 . The aforesaid appeal filed by respondent Nos.1 & 2 was , however , allowed vide impugned order dated 7.5.2004 , noticing that respondent Nos.1 & 2 herein were the patta holders in respect of the land and were not heard by the Tribunal before directing the cancellation of the pattas given to them . They had continued in possession since 1980 and it is only on issuance of notice by the appropriate authority in April , 2001 that they came to know of the Civil Appeal No.3932/2009 Page 12 of 15
