development agreement , an interest in the property may have been created in favour of the developer . If the developer is the plaintiff and the suit is against the owner , strictly applied , clause ( iii ) would require that the defendant should have obtained possession under the agreement . In such a case if the developer files a suit for specific performance against the owner , and the owner is in possession of the land by virtue of a lawful title , the defendant ( i.e. the owner ) can not be said to have obtained possession of the land by way of the agreement . This would lead to an anomalous situation where the condition in Section 14(3)(c)(iii ) would not be fulfilled in the case of a suit by a developer . Application of the literal rule of interpretation to Section 14(3)(c)(iii ) , would lead to an absurdity and would be inconsistent with the intent of the Act . 24 . The conditions that should be present to justify a departure from the plain words of any statute , have been elucidated in Justice GP Singh ’s treatise on Principles of Statutory Interpretation ' ® ( while discussing the decision of the House of Lords in Stock v Frank Jones ( Tipton ) Ltd. " ° ) : “ \ .. a court would only be justified in departing from the plain words of the statute when it is satisfied that ( 1 ) there is clear and gross balance of anomaly ; ( 2 ) Parliament , the legislative promoters and the draftsman could not have envisaged such anomaly and could not have been prepared to accept it in the interest of a supervening legislative objective ; ( 3 ) the anomaly can be obviated without detriment to such a legislative objective ; and ( 4 ) the language of the statute is susceptible of the modification required to obviate the anomaly . ” 18 Principles of Statutory Interpretation , 12 ' " Edition - 2010 , Lexis Nexis - page 144 19 ( 1978 ) 1 WLR 231 21
