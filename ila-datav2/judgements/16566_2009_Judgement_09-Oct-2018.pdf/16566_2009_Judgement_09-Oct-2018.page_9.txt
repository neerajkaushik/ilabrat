performance is not arbitrary or capricious ; it is governed by principles developed in precedents . The judge must exercise the discretion in a judicious manner .

The position as elucidated in Halsbury ’s Laws of England ® is thus : “ . , . the court does not normally order specific performance of a contract to build or repair . However , this rule is subject to important exceptions , and a decree for specific performance of a contract to build will be made if the following conditions are fulfilled : ( 1 ) that the building work is defined by the contract between the parties ; ( 2 ) that the plaintiff has a substantial interest in the performance of the contract of such a nature that he can not be adequately be compensated in damages ; ( 3 ) that the defendant is in possession of the land on which the work is contracted to be done . ” 13 . This principle was followed by the Court of Appeal in Wolverhampton Corporation v Emmons ’ , where the plaintiff , the urban sanitary authority , in pursuance of a scheme of street improvement , sold and conveyed to the defendant a plot of land abutting a street , the defendant covenanting with them that he would erect buildings within a certain time . Upon the defendant failing to perform the agreement , the plaintiffs brought a suit against him claiming specific performance . Romer L.J , held that a plaintiff can bring himself within the exception , if three things are shown to exist : ( i ) the building work , the performance of which the plaintiff seeks to enforce , is defined by the contract allowing the court to know the exact nature and extent of work ; ( ii ) the plaintiff ® Halsbury ’s Laws of England , Fourth Edition , Volume 44(1 ) , para 806 91901 ] 1K.
