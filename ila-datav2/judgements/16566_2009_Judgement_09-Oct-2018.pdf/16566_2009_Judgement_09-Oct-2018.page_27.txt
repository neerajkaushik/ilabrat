30 . The appellant has also placed reliance on the decision in Faqir Chand Gulati v Uppal Agencies Private Limited , where the issue before this Court was whether a landowner , who enters into an agreement with the builder , for construction of an apartment building is a “ consumer ” entitled to maintain a complaint against the builder as a service provider under the Consumer Protection Act , 1986 . The Court held : “ We may notice here that if there is a breach by the landowner of his obligations , the builder will have to approach a civil court as the landowner is not providing any service to the builder but merely undertakes certain obligations towards the builder , breach of which would furnish a cause of action for specific performance and/or damages . On the other hand , where the builder commits breach of his obligations , the owner has two options . He has the right to enforce specific performance and/or claim damages by approaching the civil court . Or he can approach the Forum under Consumer Protection Act , 1986 for relief as consumer , against the builder as a service- provider . ” The issue involved before this Court was in relation to the interpretation of the Consumer Protection Act , 1986 and not on the maintainability of a suit filed by the developer against the owner for specific performance in view of Section 14(3)(c ) of the Act . Therefore , the decision can not be relied upon in relation to the issue before us . 31 . Ordinarily , if there was an alternative plea for damages or monetary relief , we would have remanded the case to the High Court for consideration of the prayer . However , in the impugned judgment , the Division Bench has observed thus : 24 ( 2008 ) 10 SCC 345 27
