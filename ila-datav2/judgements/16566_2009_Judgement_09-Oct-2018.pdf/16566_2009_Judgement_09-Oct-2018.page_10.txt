must have a substantial interest in having the contract performed and the interest must be of such a nature that damages will not be an adequate compensation for the non - performance of the contract ; and ( iii ) the defendant has obtained from the plaintiff by means of the contract the possession of the land on which the work is to be done . The case was held to come within the class of cases which had been recognised as forming an exception to the general rule that specific performance of a building contract will not be ordered . 14 . In a decision of the Chancery Division in Carpenters Estate v Davies " Â® , an owner of land sold a certain portion of it to the purchaser for development , retaining land adjoining it , and agreed to lay roads and provide mains , sewers and drains on the land retained . The purchaser brought a suit for specific performance against the owner for not performing his obligations under the agreement . Farwell J. , observed that the plaintiff is required to establish that the defendant is in possession of the land on which the work is contracted to be done . The facts of the case , indicated that the defendant was already in possession of the land , and there was no difficulty for her to carry out her obligations . Finding that the plaintiff proved all three conditions as laid out in Wolverhampton Corporation ( supra ) , the court granted specific performance to the plaintiff . 10 ( 1940 ) Ch . D 160 10
