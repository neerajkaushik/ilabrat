The High Court rejected the appellant ’s argument that even if Section 14(3)(c ) stood in the way of getting a decree for specific performance , the Specific Relief Act not being exhaustive , there was no bar in granting a decree . The High Court held : “ \ ... ifin the Act there is a clear prohibition in granting a decree for specific performance in a given situation , such provision is exhaustive and can not be made nugatory by contending that the Act is not exhaustive and thus , the Court can ignore such provision . ” 9 . The High Court also rejected the argument of the appellant that the agreement in question was not a contract for construction of building on the land in a real sense , as the respondent was not getting any consideration for building . The High Court held that the agreement was in substance a contract of construction within the meaning of sub - section ( 3)(c ) of Section 14 and the consideration was payable only upon the completion of the work . 10 . The issue which has been raised before this Court is whether Section 14(3)(c ) of the Act is a bar to a suit by a developer for specific performance of a development agreement between himself and the owner of the property . In dealing with this issue , the court needs to assess whether the word “ defendant ” in Section 14(3)(c)(iii ) has the effect of confining the scope of the suit for specific performance only to a particular class ( consisting of owners ) or whether a purposive interpretation to the legislation would be required , so as to provide a broader set of remedies to both owners and developers . In deciding this issue the court will need to scrutinise the nature of a development agreement . 6
