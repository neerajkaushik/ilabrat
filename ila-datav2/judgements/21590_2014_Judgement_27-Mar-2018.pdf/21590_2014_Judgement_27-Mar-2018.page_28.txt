to proceed on the complaint under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. and during investigation some material is found , the counsel can not really object to the inclusion of the name of respondent No.1 at that stage . However , inclusion at this stage is stated to be without any material facts and is an embarrassment , considering the constitutional position held by respondent No.1 . 45 . We have given a thought to the respective pleas of the parties . 46 . No doubt the process under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. is only one of investigation . The larger question , of whether any such direction can be issued without prior sanction has been referred to a larger bench . Were the appellant to succeed and were the matter to go back to the Magistrate and the Magistrate after application of mind forms an opinion to direct investigation by the police , it would be always open to the Magistrate to include the name of respondent No.1 if such material is found against him . 47 . Merely because the appellant has roped in respondent No.1 in the complaint is not sufficient ground to allow his name to be included Page 28 of 30
