24 , Srinivas Gundluri v. SEPCO Electric Power Construction Corpn . ” * ( two Judges Bench ) — The Magistrate in the case had merely allowed the application filed by the complainant under Section 156(3 ) of the CrP.C. and sent the same along with its annexure for investigation by the police officer and that was held not to have amounted to having taken cognizance . 25 . Subramanian Swamy v. CBI ’ ( five Judges Bench ) — It was observed that Section 156 of the Cr . P.C. enables an officer in charge of a police station to investigate a cognizable offence . Insofar as noncognizable offences are concerned , it was found that the police officer by virtue of Section 155 Cr . P.C. can investigate it after obtaining appropriate orders from the Magistrate having power to try such case or commit the case for trial regardless of the status of the officer concerned . In view thereof , the scheme of Sections 155 and 156 of the Cr . P.C. was held to indicate that the local police may investigate a senior government officer without previous approval of the Central Government . 16(2010 ) 8 SCC 206 17(2014 ) 8 SCC 682 Page 17 of 30
