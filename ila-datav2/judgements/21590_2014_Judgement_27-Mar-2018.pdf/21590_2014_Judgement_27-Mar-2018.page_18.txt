The Constitution Bench while dealing with the inquiry and investigation under the P.C. Act held that there was no basis to classify the two sets of public servants differently on the ground that one set of officers is decision - making officers and not the other set of officers . 26 . Despite the aforesaid catena of judgments , a different path has been traversed in two judgments of this Court where the offences alleged are under the P.C. Act read with the I.P.C. 27 . In Anil Kumar v. M.K. Aiyappa ™ ( two Judges Bench ) , the Court proceeded to examine whether the Magistrate , while exercising his powers under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. , could act in a mechanical or casual manner and go on with the complaint after getting the report . In that context , a reference was made to an earlier judgment in Maksud Saiyed v. State of Gujarat ’ ? case , where it was observed that there was a requirement of the application of mind by the Magistrate before exercising jurisdiction under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. Thereafter the Bench proceeded to draw a conclusion that a Special Judge / Magistrate can not refer the matter under Section 156(3 ) 18 supra 19(2008 ) 5 SCC 668 Page 18 of 30
