21 . In Nirmaljit Singh Hoon v. State of W.B. ™ ( three Judges Bench ) , it was sought to be canvassed that the investigation by the police being one ordered by the Chief Presidency Magistrate under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. , that investigation was part of the proceedings of the Court . This plea was rejected inter alia on the ground that the police authorities have , under Sections 154 & 156 of the Cr . P.C. , a statutory right to investigate into a cognizable offence without requiring any sanction from a judicial authority . Secondly , for taking cognizance under Section190(1)(a ) of the Cr . P.C. , a Magistrate must not only have applied his mind but must have done so for purposes of proceeding under Section 200 and the provisions following that Section . The application of mind only for ordering investigation under Section 156(3 ) or issuing a warrant for purposes of investigation could not be said to have taken cognizance of the offence . 14 22 . Devarapally Lakshminarayana Reddy v. V. Narayana Reddy ( three Judges Bench ) — Mr. Prashant Bhushan referred to the aforesaid judgment for analysis of Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C.
