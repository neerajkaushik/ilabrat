38 . We have passed a detailed order making a reference to a larger Bench insofar as the main matter is concerned . It may be noticed that in the present Special Leave Petition , notice was issued to the Respondents , except Respondent No . 4 . Since the proceedings before the Magistrate at the threshold were directed to be kept in abeyance without notice to the Respondent , and thereafter the revision petition was dismissed in limine by the High Court , the occasion for Respondent No.1 to have knowledge of the proceedings did not arise . Respondent No.1 seeks deletion from the array of parties in these proceedings as he has been wrongly arrayed as a party . 39 . The aforesaid plea is predicated on the averments in the complaint itself , which seeks to make a grievance over the actions of the Principal Secretary , Public Health and Engineering Department ( PHED ) in which capacity respondent No.1 is stated to have been arrayed . It is averred in the application that respondent No.1 was serving as a Secretary and Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister and not as Principal Secretary , PHED . In fact , the officer working as the Principal Secretary , PHED has not been arrayed as a respondent . There is no allegation made against the Secretary / Principal Secretary to Page 25 of 30
