circumscribed by that section an investigation “ for the purpose of deciding whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding ” . Thus the object of an investigation under Section 202 is not to initiate a fresh case on police report but to assist the Magistrate in completing proceedings already instituted upon a complaint before him . ” 23 . In Tula Ram v. Kishore Singh * ( two Judges Bench ) — cited before us , it was observed that Sections 190 and 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. are mutually exclusive and work in totally different spheres . Thus , even if a Magistrate receives a complaint under Section 190 , he can act under Section 156(3 ) provided that he does not take cognizance . Chapter 14 deals with post cognizance stage while Chapter 12 , so far as the Magistrate is concerned , deals with pre - cognizance stage , that is to say that even when a Magistrate starts acting under Section 190 and the provisions following , he can not resort to Section 156(3 ) . Thus , Section 202 would apply only in cases where the Magistrate has taken cognizance and chooses to inquire into the complaint either himself or through any other agency . Before proceeding to do so , there may be a situation where the Magistrate , before taking cognizance himself , chooses to order a pure and simple investigation under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr .
