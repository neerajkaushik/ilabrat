would be some consequences to follow were the Magistrate to act in a mechanical and mindless manner . That can not be the test . 34 , The catena of judgments on the issue as to the scope and power of direction by a Magistrate under Chapters 12 & 14 is well established . Thus , the question would be whether in cases of the P.C. Act , a different import has to be read qua the power to be exercised under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. , i.e. , can it be said that on account of Section 19(1 ) of the P.C. Act , the scope of inquiry under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. can be said to be one of taking ‘ cognizance ’ thereby requiring the prior sanction in case of a public servant ? It is trite to say that prior sanction to prosecute a public servant for offences under the P.C. Act is a provision contained under Chapter 14 of the Cr . P.C .. Thus , whether such a purport can be imported into Chapter 12 of the Cr . P.C. while directing an investigation under Section 156(3 ) of the Cr . P.C. , merely because a public servant would be involved , would beg an answer . 35 . The apprehension expressed by the learned ASG possibly arises from the observations in Suresh Chand Jain v.
