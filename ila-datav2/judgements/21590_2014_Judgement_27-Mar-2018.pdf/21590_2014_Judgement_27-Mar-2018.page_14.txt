Only if he forms an opinion that the allegations therein disclose a cognizable offence and the forwarding of the complaint to the police for investigation under Section 156(3 ) will be conducive to justice and save the valuable time of the Magistrate from being wasted in enquiring into a matter which was primarily the duty of the police to investigate , he will be justified in adopting that course as an alternative to taking cognizance of the offence , himself .

The ways in which such cognizance can be taken are set out in clauses ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of Section 190(1 ) .
