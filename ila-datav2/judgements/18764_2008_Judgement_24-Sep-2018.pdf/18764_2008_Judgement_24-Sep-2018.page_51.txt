51 would be a nullity in the eye of law though such orders have attained finality . Following observations were made : “ 27 . The said order is passed by the State Government only to enquire into the landholding records with a view to find out as to whether original land revenue records have been destroyed and fabricated_to substantiate their unjustifiable claim by playing fraud upon the Tehsildar and appellate authorities to obtain the orders unlawfully in their favour by showing that there is no surplus land with the Company and its shareholders as the valid subleases are made and they are accepted by them in the proceedings Under Section 21 of the Act , on the basis of the alleged false declarations filed by the shareholders _ and_sublessees Under Section 6 of the Act . The plea urged on behalf of the State Government and the de - facto complainants - owners , at whose instance the orders are passed by the State Government on the alleged ground of fraud played by the declarants upon the Tehsildar and appellate authorities to get the illegal orders obtained by them to come out from the clutches of the land ceiling provisions of the Act by creating the revenue records , which is the fraudulent act on their part which unravels everything and therefore , the question of limitation under the provisions to exercise power by the State Government does not arise at all . For this purpose , the Deputy Commissioner of Pune Division was appointed as the Enquiry Officer to hold such an enquiry to enquire into the matter and submit his report for consideration of the Government to take further action in the matter . The legal contentions urged by Mr. Naphade , in justification of the impugned judgment and order prima facie at this stage , we are satisfied that the allegation of fraud in relation to getting the land holdings of the villages referred to supra by the declarants_on the alleged ground of destroying original revenue records and fabricating revenue records to show that there are 384 sub - leases of the land involved in the proceedings to retain the surplus land illegally as alleged , to the extent of more than 3000 acres _ of land and the orders are obtained unlawfully by the declarants in the land ceiling limits will be nullity in the eye of law though such orders have attained finality , if it is found in the enquiry by the Enquiry Officer that they are tainted with fraud , the same can be interfered with by the State Government and its officers to pass appropriate orders . The landowners are also aggrieved parties to agitate their rights to get the orders which are obtained by the declarants as they are vitiated in law on account of nullity is the tenable submission and the same is well founded and therefore , we accept the submission to justify the impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court . ”    ( emphasis supplied )
