Pursuant to the order of vesting , the competent authority under the Abolition Act i.e. Compensation Officer , Mahasu , vide order dated 12.4.1966 determined the compensation of Rs.28,019.45 . Since the Zamindar had already received an amount of Rs.1,703.25 in excess from the tenants who had acquired proprietary rights under section 11 of the Abolition Act , same was deducted from the amount and the amount payable was found to be Rs.26,316.20 and it was actually paid on 6.5.1966 . 8 . As against the order passed by the Compensation Officer dated 12.4.1966 , the appeal was preferred before the District Judge , Mahasu . The appeal was partly allowed and the direction which was made of deduction of Rs.1703.25 was set aside and the payment of entire Rs.28,019.45 was ordered without aforesaid deduction . 9 . As against the decision of the Judicial Commissioner dated 14.11.1962 , the matter travelled to this Court in C.A. Nos.11861191/1966 . This Court held that vesting under section 27 , the right , title and interest of the owner in landholding in case land revenue of the holding exceed Rs.125 per year , would vest free from all encumbrances in the State Government and the vesting is automatic and without being contingent on the happening of any other event .
