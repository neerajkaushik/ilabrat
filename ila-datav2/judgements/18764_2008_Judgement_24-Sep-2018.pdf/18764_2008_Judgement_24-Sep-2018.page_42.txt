The effect is that order of vesting has attained finality even otherwise withdrawal of suit does not check running of limitation as provided in Order 23 Rule 2 CPC . It is futile and too late in the day to allow the respondent to lay such a claim . 58 . As a matter of fact , the withdrawal of civil suit No.15/1970 was made on the statement of learned counsel on behalf of plaintiff Rajinder Singh that disputed land had been declared as surplus in the ceiling proceedings , compensation had been received and under the provisions of the Ceiling Act . The suit was permitted to be withdrawn with liberty to file fresh suit whereas there was no such formal defect . Be that as it may . Once suit has been withdrawn on the ground that land had been declared surplus and compensation had been received it would create estoppel against the plaintiff to contend to contrary and from claiming compensation under the LA Act notwithstanding permission to file suit because as a matter of fact also , the disputed land had been declared surplus on 30.6.1980 and additional land in 1993 . The land declared as surplus in 1980 attained finality , as well as order of the Financial Commissioner on 5.9.1985 . Both the orders also attained finality . Thus , the order of remand dated 5.9.1985 having attained finality , and it would not be possible to reopen it at any subsequent stage . Thus , the orders dated 30.6.1980 and 5.9.1985
