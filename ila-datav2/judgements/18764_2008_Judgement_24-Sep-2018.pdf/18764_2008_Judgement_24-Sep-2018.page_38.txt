38 54 . The fact is conclusively established that land in question had been declared as surplus and compensation under the Ceiling Act had also been received , even though the land had already vested in the State under the Abolition Act . Once the disputed land had been admittedly declared surplus in Ceiling Act vide order dated 30.6.1980 , there was no question of payment of compensation to Rajinder Singh or to his legal representatives in proceedings initiated later on in the year 1987 under the L.A. Act . The Land Acquisition Collector in 1989 was justified in directing that the compensation determined should not be paid due to the effect of the Ceiling Act and that question was raised in the Reference Court also , it was incumbent upon the Reference Court to go into the aforesaid aspects . It was not fact situation that question of the title has been disputed and decided in reference proceedings but whether Rajinder Singh or his LRs . were entitled to claim compensation in view of the proceedings and that orders passed under the Abolition Act and Ceiling Act were definitely required to be gone into . Thus , we are of the considered opinion that once land has been declared surplus and compensation has been received . It was not open to receive it again in the land acquisition Case .
