30 filed by Rajinder Singh . This Court in proceedings under section 27 of Abolition Act vide order dated 17.9.1969 ordered that the land only under personal cultivation was saved and not any other land . The finding recorded in the remand order on the question of law is binding otherwise also the position of law is what was held by this Court in the aforesaid decision . After this Court remitted the matter for examination of the question which was the land under personal cultivation that would only be saved from vesting . To avoid rigor of the order the writ petition was withdrawn by Late Rajinder Singh with liberty to file a civil suit and Suit No.15/1970 was filed . The stand taken was that the said land was Banjar , Abadi , Gharat , Kohlu , and Gair - Mumkin . The stand taken that the land was Ghasni that is wasteland and Banjar land itself indicated that the land was not under personal cultivation and thus as per the case set up in Civil Suit by the plaintiff , Rajinder Singh it was clear that he has abandoned the stand that the land was under personal cultivation and took the aforesaid stand . The said stand itself made clear that the land was not under personal cultivation , at the time of abolition and had vested in the State and we have no hesitation to arrive at the said conclusion based on the case set up by the plaintiff in the course of civil suit No.15/1970 .
