29 64 bighas 12 Biswas only as specified . It is apparent from the order dated 27.2.1962 Khata No.1 Kita measuring 1011 bighas 6 Biswas vested in the ownership of Government of Himachal Pradesh in village Jhakri . In the review on 19.9.1964 , there was only partial modification with respect to area 14 bighas 12 Biswas . The land revenue of land at Jakhri as apparent from Jamabandi of 1955 - 56 at the time when the Abolition Act came into force was Rs.155.58 it was more than Rs.125 as such the land which was Banjar kadim or otherwise not under personal cultivation had vested in the State . 45 . Under the Abolition Act compensation was determined under the provisions of section 27(1 ) and was ordered to be paid by the Compensation Officer , Mahasu District , Kasumpti vide order dated 12.4.1966 . Sum of Rs.28,019 had been paid to Rajinder Singh . Though payment of compensation was not a condition precedent for vesting of land it was automatic , Rajinder Singh was paid compensation also for the land mentioned in the order of Compensation Officer . Even if the compensation was not paid for some land , as that was not under personal cultivation had also automatically vested free from all encumbrances in the State . 46 . The subsequent attempt made by Rajinder Singh to claim that the land was not covered under the definition of land , was wholly frivolous , unacceptable and was rightly rejected in C.S. No.15/1970
