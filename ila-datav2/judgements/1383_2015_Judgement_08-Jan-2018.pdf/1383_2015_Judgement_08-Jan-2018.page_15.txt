of Meena Devi is homicidal ( evidence of PW-24 ) ; ( iv ) Conduct of accused in not reporting to the police about missing of the deceased Meena Devi ; and ( v ) Absence of explanation from the accused as to the death of the deceased . The circumstances relied upon by the prosecution are proved by cogent and reliable evidence . The circumstances cumulatively taken form a complete chain pointing out that the murder was committed by the accused and none - else . 19 . In the appeal , the High Court has not properly appreciated the evidence and intrinsic worth of testimony of prosecution witnesses and the formidable circumstances established by the prosecution against the accused . The High Court entertained fanciful doubts and rejected the credible evidence of Jeewan Lal ( PW-1 ) on slender grounds . Due to mis - appreciation of evidence , the High Court set aside the conviction and caused a miscarriage of justice . Reasonings of the High Court for acquitting the accused are unsustainable and the impugned judgment can not be sustained . Page No . 15 of 13
