no laxity and laxity can not be condoned in face of the command that the report shall be made forthwith . The legislative mandate , however , can not be measured mathematically in terms of seconds , minutes and hours in order to find whether the report was made forthwith . Administrative exigencies may on occasions render a post - haste compliance impossible and therefore a reasonable allowance has to be made for unavoidable delays . ” 13 . From the above cases , the position that emerges is that “ forthwith , ” under Section 3(4 ) , does not mean instantaneous , but without undue delay and within reasonable time . Whether the authority passing the detention order reported the detention to the State Government within reasonable time and without undue delay , is to be ascertained from the facts of the case . In Joglekar , there was a delay of eight days by the Police Commissioner , in sending the report to the State Government . However , the court found that the reasons for the delay were reasonable , since the Commissioner and his team were occupied in maintaining law and order during a particularly tense time in Mumbai . 14 . | The High Court held in its impugned judgment that : “ While the delay in furnishing grounds of detention under Section 8 of the Act may prejudice the right of the detenu as guaranteed under Article 22(5 ) of the Constitution , furnishing of the grounds of detention under Section 3(4 ) may not prejudice the detenu so long as the report along with the grounds of detention are furnished within a reasonable time , but certainly within 12 days of the detention . .. If the report along with the grounds of detention is submitted beyond 12 days , it would certainly vitiate the detention order as without the report and the grounds of detention , the State Government could not have applied their minds whether to approve or not to approve the detention order under Section 3(4 ) of the Act . ”
