Constitution by establishment of new States ; alteration in the area and boundaries of existing States and also by abolition of the three ( 03 ) categories of States ; and by classification of certain areas as Union Territories . Pursuant thereto the Government of Union Territories Act , 1963 was enacted to provide for Legislative Assemblies and Councils of Ministers for certain Union Territories and for certain other incidental matters . It will not be necessary to specifically deal with the provisions of the aforesaid Act in any great detail except to say that in course of time most of the Union Territories ( except for Pondicherry ) , which had been provided with their own Legislatures and Councils of Ministers have graduated to become full - fledged States on the basis of enactment of several State Reorganisation Acts details of which have been mentioned ( para 21 ) . The Union Territory of Pondicherry , as on date , stands out as sole Union Territory which has a Legislature and Council of Ministers , apart from Delhi . 48
