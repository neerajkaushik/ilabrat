22 person who is illegally restrained of his liberty . The Court further elaborated : “ ... The writ of habeas corpus is one of the most ancient writs known to the common law of England . It is a writ of immemorial antiquity and the first threads of its origin are woven deeply within the “ seamless web of history ” and they are concealed and perhaps untraceable among countless incidents that constituted the total historical pattern . ” 24 . Tracing the history , the Court proceeded to explicate : “ The writ of habeas corpus cum causa made its appearance in the early years of the fourteenth century . It not merely commanded the Sheriff to “ have the body ” of the person therein mentioned like its predecessor but added the words “ with the cause of the arrest and detention ” . The person who had the custody of a prisoner was required by this writ to produce him before the Court together with the ground for the detention . The writ thus became a means of testing the legality of the detention and in this form it may be regarded as the immediate ancestor of the modern writ of habeas corpus . The writ of habeas corpus cum causa was utilised by the common law courts during the fifteenth century as an accompaniment of the writs of certiorari and privilege to assert their jurisdiction against the local and franchise courts . ” 25 .
