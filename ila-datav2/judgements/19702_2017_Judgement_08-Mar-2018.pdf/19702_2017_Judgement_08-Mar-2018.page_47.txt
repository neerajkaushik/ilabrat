8 47 The principal findings which have been recorded by the High Court need to be visited and are summarised below : ( i ) ( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) ( v ) ( vi ) ( vii ) ( viii ) This was “ not a case of a girl falling in love with a boy of a different religion and wanting to get married to him ” but an “ arranged marriage ” where Hadiya had no previous acquaintance with Shafin Jahan ; Hadiya met Shafin Jahan on an online portal called “ Way to Nikah ” ; During the course of the proceedings , Hadiya had stated before the court that she desired to complete her studies as a student of Homeopathy and “ nobody had a case at that time that she wanted to get married ” ; Though on 19 December 2016 , the High Court adjourned the hearing to 21 December 2016 to enable her to proceed to her college , the marriage took place on the same day ; The marriage was “ only a make - believe intended to take the detenue out of reach of the hands of this court ” ; The conduct of the parties in conducting the marriage without informing the court was unacceptable ; There is no document evidencing the conversion of Hadiya to Islam ; the antecedents of Shafin Jahan and his Facebook posts show a radical inclination ; and No prudent parent would decide to get his daughter married to a person accused in a criminal case . The High Court concluded that the marriage “ is only a sham and is of no consequence ” , a charade to force the hands of the court .
