46 Confronted with the undisputed fact that Hadiya is a major , the High Court still observed : “ This Court exercising Parens Patriae jurisdiction has a duty to ensure that young girls like the detenue are not exploited or transported out of the country . Though the learned Senior Counsel has vociferously contended that the detenue is a person who has attained majority , it is necessary to bear in mind the fact that the detenue who is a female in her twenties is at a vulnerable age . As per Indian tradition , the custody of an unmarried daughter is with the parents , until she is properly married . We consider it the duty of this Court to ensure that a person under such a vulnerable state is not exposed to further danger , especially in the circumstances noticed above where even her marriage is stated to have been performed with another person , in accordance with Islamic religious rites . That too , with the connivance of the 7 " respondent with whom she was permitted to reside , by this Court . ” Hadiya was under judicial order transported to a hostel at Ernakulam , with a direction that : “ she is not provided the facility of possessing or using a mobile phone . ” Save and except for her parents no one was allowed to meet her . An investigation was ordered into the “ education , family background , antecedents and other relevant details ” of Shafin Jahan together with others involved in the ‘ conduct ’ of the marriage . The High Court continued to monitor the case on 6 January 2017 , 31 January 2017 , 7 February 2017 and 22 February 2017 . Eventually , by its judgment and order dated 24 May 2017 , the High Court allowed the petition for habeas corpus and issued the directions noted above .
