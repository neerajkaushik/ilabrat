54 With the passing of that order the writ petition was withdrawn on 25 January 2016 . Yet , again , when a second petition was filed , it was evident before the High Court that Hadiya had no desire to stay with her parents . She is a major . The Division Bench on this occasion paid scant regard to the earlier outcome and to the decision of a coordinate Bench . The High Court inexplicably sought to deviate from the course adopted in the earlier proceeding . 16 The schism between Hadiya and her father may be unfortunate . But it was no part of the jurisdiction of the High Court to decide what it considered to be a ‘ just ’ way of life or ‘ correct ’ course of living for Hadiya . She has absolute autonomy over her person . Hadiya appeared before the High Court and stated that she was not under illegal confinement . There was no warrant for the High Court to proceed further in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 . The purpose of the habeas corpus petition ended . It had to be closed as the earlier Bench had done . The High Court has entered into a domain which is alien to its jurisdiction in a habeas corpus petition . The High Court did not take kindly to the conduct of Hadiya , noting that when it had adjourned the proceedings to issue directions to enable her to pursue her studies , it was at that stage that she appeared with Shafin Jahan only to inform the court of their marriage . How Hadiya chooses to lead her life is entirely a matter of her choice . The High Court 's view of her lack of candour with the court has no bearing on the legality of her marriage or her right to decide for herself , whom she desires to live with or marry .
