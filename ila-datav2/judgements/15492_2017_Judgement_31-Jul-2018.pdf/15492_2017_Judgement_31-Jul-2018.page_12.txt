12 Insurance Company who had challenged the award in favour of the claimants and in those appeals , the claimants ( including appellants in Civil Appeal No.9078 of 2017 ) filed cross objections which , however , came to be dismissed for non- removal of office objections . Nevertheless , the High Court enhanced the compensation amount payable to them by invoking power under Order 41 Rule 33 of the Civil Procedure Code ( C.P.C. ) . The Insurance Company has not challenged the said view taken by the High Court as it has already succeeded in getting a finding from the High Court that the liability to pay compensation amount was restricted to that of the owner of the offending vehicle , namely respondent No.2 herein . 12 . Assuming that the legal representatives of the deceased ( Satish ) ( appellant in Civil Appeal No.9078 of 2017 ) could ask for enhancement of the compensation amount in the present appeal whilst challenging the finding of the High Court to absolve the Insurance Company of its liability to pay the compensation amount , the question is whether the appellants are justified in claiming further enhanced compensation amount .
