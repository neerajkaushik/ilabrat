10 8 . The insurer succeeded before the High Court , as the liability to pay compensation amount has been restricted to that of the owner of the offending vehicle . Therefore , the insurer did not file appeal against the enhancement of compensation amount payable to the legal representatives of the deceased ( Satish ) . The present appeal ( Civil Appeal No.9078 of 2017 ) , however , has been filed by the widow and daughter of the deceased ( Satish ) . They have challenged not only the correctness of the view taken by the High Court absolving the insurer from the liability to pay compensation but also for further enhancement of compensation amount . Similarly , Anand , the injured pillion rider , has also filed a separate appeal challenging the decision of the High Court in restricting the liability to pay compensation amount to that of the owner of the offending vehicle but also on the quantum of compensation amount . In both the appeals , it is alternatively urged that the compensation amount payable to the respective claimants should be first paid by the Insurance Company with liberty to recover the same from the owner of the offending vehicle , respondent No.2 herein .
