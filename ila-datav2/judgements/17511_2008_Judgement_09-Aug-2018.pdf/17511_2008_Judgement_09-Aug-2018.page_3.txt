3 asked for or paid as a motive or reward for inducing a public servant to do an act or do a favour or render some service as stated under Section 8 of the Act . In the present case , the evidence adduced by the prosecution is vague for whom the appellant had demanded the money and whether the person for whom the appellant demanded and received the money is a public servant . Though the receiver of the money , like in the present case may not be a public servant , the prosecution has to establish by convincing evidence that the amount must have been received for inducing a public servant for doing something by that public servant in his official capacity . So far as confirmation of the seat in the Indian Airlines , there may be persons in the middle who may be a public servant or a travel agency or others . In the absence of convincing evidence to show that the appellant had received the money from PW-4,to induce a public servant to get the confirmation of the ticket , the conviction of the appellant under Section 8 of the PC Act can not be sustained . In the result the appeal is allowed and the appellant is acquitted . The appellant is on bail . His bail bonds shall stand discharged . [ VINEET SARAN ] NEW DELHI 9th AUGUST , 2018
