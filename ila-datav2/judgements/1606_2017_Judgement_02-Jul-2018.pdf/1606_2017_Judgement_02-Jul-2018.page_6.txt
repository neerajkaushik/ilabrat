6 The Division Bench of the High Court vide its judgment dated 04.04.2016 has dismissed the appeal . The Division Bench came to the following conclusions while dismissing the appeal : " We have , therefore , no manner of doubt from a reading of the provisions of the Industrial Area Development Act that the NOIDA has been constituted by the State Act and , therefore , entitled to exemption of payment of tax at source under section 194-A(1 ) of the Act . The decision of the Division Bench of this Court in New Okhla Industrial Development Authority ( supra ) , on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the appellants , would , therefore , not come to the aid of the appellants as it was restricted to the issue as to whether NOIDA would be a local authority or not and did not deal with the issue involved in this appeal as to whether the NOIDA is a Corporation established by a State Act . We therefore , answer the question of law framed by us in negative and hold that NOIDA is a Corporation established by Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act , 1976 . ‚Äù 7 . Shri K. Radhakrishnan , learned senior advocate appearing for the appellants challenging the Division Bench judgment of the High Court contends that Authority is not entitled for the benefit of Notification dated 22.10.1970 issued under Section 194A ( 3)(iii)(f ) .
