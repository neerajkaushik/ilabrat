30 29 . In Sant Dnyaneshwar Shikshan Shastra Mahavidyalaya ( supra ) Court further observed that proviso to sub - section 5 of Section 5 must be construed with respect to “ proposed location ” . The essentiality certificate could not be dealt with by the State Government on any policy consideration inasmuch as the policy and the matter of establishment of new medical college rested with the Central Government alone . In the instant case , it is mainly with respect to local area i.e. , the city of Hyderabad which power has been saved by this Court even in the aforesaid dictum . 30 . In Thirumuruga Kirupananda Variyar Thavathiru Sundara Swamigal Medical Education & Charitable Trust v. State of Tamil Nadu , ( 1996 ) 3 SCC 15 , the provisions of Tamil Nadu Medical University Act , 1987 came up for consideration . The provisions of the Act are different . For the establishment of a Medical College , State Essentiality Certificate and affiliation from University is required . In the instant case , the matter is about the proposed location and affiliation out of 36 Pharmacy colleges in the State of Telangana and 30 are located in Hyderabad city alone which are more than adequate in number . Thus , rightly decision has been taken not to start another new course at the proposed location at Hyderabad city . Thus , the said decision is no avail to espouse the cause of the respondents .
