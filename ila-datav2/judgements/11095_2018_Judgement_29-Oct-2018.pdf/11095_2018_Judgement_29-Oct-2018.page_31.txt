31 31 . The respondents have also referred to the decision in Rungta Engineering College , Bhilai v. Chhattisgarh Swami Vivekananda Technical University , ( 2015 ) 11 SCC 291 , wherein question came up for consideration with respect to the power of examining authority i.e. , University and State Government , to withdraw provisional affiliation or to decline grant of affiliation . The decision was taken to disapprove provisional affiliation granted to the college . This Court observed that the objections on the basis of which action was taken squarely fall within the sweep of one or the other areas which only AICTE has exclusive jurisdiction to deal with . These shortcomings ought to have been brought to the notice of AICTE to take appropriate action against the college . On facts of the instant case , the decision can not be applied as it is not the case of shortcomings . 32 . Resultantly , the appeal deserves to be allowed , same is hereby allowed . We quash the impugned judgment and order . No costs . seise sees eeeseenesvexenvesesseaws J. ( Arun Mishra ) sescscecccscscscecescscececeees J. ( Indira Banerjee ) October 29 , 2018 New Delhi .
