Amarendra Sharan , Mr . Mukul Rohtagi and Dr. A.M. Singhvi , learned Senior Advocates for the respondents - accused . 7 . In our view the assessment made by the High Court at a stage when the investigation was yet to be completed , is completely incorrect and uncalled for . Presence of two crucial facts was enough to let the investigation go on , namely , recovery of huge amount of cash of Rs.7.2 crores from the house of one of the accused and that such recovery was accepted by the accused . The explanation given by them about the alleged transaction of agreement of sale and receipt of cash in pursuance thereof does not prima facie appear to be correct . The agreement is stated to have been entered on 02.03.2012 while the stamp paper in question was issued by the relevant department on 09.03.2012 to the vendor which was later sold to lady named Vimla on 13.3.2012 . Whether the possession of huge cash amounting to Rs . 7.2 crores can be explained by the accused and whether such explanation be accepted or not , are all matters which will be gone into at the relevant stage in the proceedings . The investigation in any case ought not to have been set at naught but it ought to have been permitted to be taken to its logical conclusion . 8 . We are not expressing any opinion on merits or demerits of either the case of the prosecution or the defence of the accused but we are of the firm
