12 Section 14 of the Limitation Act in respect of the period spent in pursuing the proceedings before the District Judge , Port Blair , the petition under Section 34 was filed much beyond the outer period of ninety days . 15 The respondent has relied on the decision of this Court in Union of India v Tecco Trichy Engineers & Contractors â€™ , where this Court had to decide the effective date from which the limitation within the meaning of subsection ( 3 ) of Section 34 of the Act shall be calculated . The Chief Project Manager on behalf of the Southern Railway had entered into a contract with a contractor for construction of a railway bridge . Disputes between the parties were referred to arbitration and an award was delivered in the office of the General Manager , Southern Railway . The Chief Engineer preferred an application against the award under Section 34 of the 1996 Act before the High Court . The learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court rejected the application holding it as barred by limitation . This Court reversed the order of the High Court and condoned the application for delay . This Court observed that in huge organisations like the Railways having different divisional heads and various departments within the division , the copy of the award had to be received by the person who had knowledge of the proceedings and who would be the best person to understand and appreciate the award and grounds for challenge . This Court found that all arbitral proceedings for the Railways were being represented by the Chief Engineer 9 ( 2005 ) 4 SCC 239
