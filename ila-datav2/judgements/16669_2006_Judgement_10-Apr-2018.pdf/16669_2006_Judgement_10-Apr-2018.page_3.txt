No.1 as final order . The second defendant filed a Revenue suit No . 214/95 against defendant No.1 under Section 183 of Rajasthan Tenancy Act before Sub - Divisional Officer , Hanumangarh for getting possession of the land . This suit was decided on 11.3.97 in his favour and he got possession of the land by execution of the said decree . The appeal filed by the plaintiff against the said decree was dismissed on 3.11.78 . The Will executed in his favour was also challenged unsuccessfully by the plaintiff . The present suit has been filed suppressing all these material facts . 4 . On the basis of the pleadings of the parties , the trial court framed relevant issues . The parties led evidence in support of their respective contentions . On appreciation of the materials on record , the trial court decreed the suit by directing defendant No.1 to execute the sale deed in respect of the land in question in favour of the plaintiff . The decree of the trial court directing the first defendant to execute the sale deed was set aside by the High Court and defendant no.1 was directed to refund the amount received by her under the aforesaid agreement . 5 . The main contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that defendant No.2 relied on a Will said to have been executed by Buta Singh , husband of the first defendant . He has failed to produce the said Will in the proceedings before the trial court or before the High Court . Therefore , the High Court was not justified in dismissing the suit in so far as specific performance of the agreement dated 27.5.1996 is concerned .
