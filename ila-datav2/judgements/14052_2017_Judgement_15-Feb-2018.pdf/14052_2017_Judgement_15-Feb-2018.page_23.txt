38 ) The learned Judge speaking for the Bench in his distinctive style of writing reminded the Courts to keep the following observations in mind while deciding the rights of the parties which reads as under : “ A code of procedure must be regarded as such . It is procedure something designed to facilitate justice and further its ends : not a penal enactment ffor punishment and penalties ; not a thing designed to trip people up . Too technical a construction of sections that leaves no room for reasonable elasticity of interpretation should therefore be guarded against ( provided always that justice is done to both sides ) lest the very means designed for the furtherance of justice be used to frustrate it . Our laws of procedure are grounded on a principle of natural justice which requires that men should not be condemned unheard , that decisions should not be reached behind their backs , that proceedings that affect their lives and property should not continue in _ their absence and that they should not be precluded from participating in them . Of course , there must be exceptions and where they are clearly defined they must be given effect to . But taken by and large , and subject to that proviso , our laws of procedure should be construed , wherever that is reasonably possible , in the light of that principle . ” 23
