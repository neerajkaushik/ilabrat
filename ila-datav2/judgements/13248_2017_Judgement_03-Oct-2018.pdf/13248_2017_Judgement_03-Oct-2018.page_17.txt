17 expression “ a company or ” in Section 2(1)(f)(iii ) of the Act can not possibly be said to refer to a company registered and incorporated in India which may be controlled by persons in a country outside India . The Court held : “ 20 . The learned counsel contends that the word " or " being disjunctive , sub - clause ( iii ) of Section 2(1)(f ) of the 1996 Act shall apply in a case where sub - clause ( ii ) shall not apply . We do not agree . The question of taking recourse to sub - clause ( iii ) would come into play only in a case where sub - clause ( ii ) otherwise does not apply in its entirety and not where by reason of an exclusion clause , consideration for construing an agreement to be an international commercial arbitration agreement goes outside the purview of its definition . Once it is held that both the companies are incorporated in India , and , thus , they have been domiciled in India , the arbitration agreement entered into by and between them would not be an international commercial arbitration agreement and , thus , the question of applicability of sub - clause ( iii ) of Section 2(1)(f ) would not arise . ” The Law Commission Report No . 246 of August 2014 , which made several amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act , 1996 , gave the following reason for deleting the words “ a company or ” : “ ( iii ) In sub - section ( 1 ) , clause ( f ) , sub - clause ( iii ) , delete the words “ a company or ” before the words “ an association or a body of individuals . [ NOTE : The reference to “ a company ” In sub - section ( iii ) has been removed since the same is already covered under sub - section ( ii ) . The intention is to determine the residence of a company based on its place of incorporation and not the place of central management / control . This further re - enforces the “ place of incorporation ” principle laid down by the Supreme
