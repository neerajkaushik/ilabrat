Possession of the flat was offered to the Respondent — Purchaser in December 2015 after obtaining the Completion Certificate for the building . Even though the Agreement provided for delivery of possession by 31.10.2013 , the delay occurred because of various legal impediments in timely completion of the project because of various Orders passed by the National Green Tribunal . The delay ought to be computed from 6 months after 31.10.2013 , i. from 01.05.2014 by taking into consideration , the 6 months grace period provided in the Agreement . Furthermore , the period of Interest should close on April 2016 when the Full Occupancy Certificate was obtained as per the admission of the Respondent — Purchaser herself in Para 4(j ) of the Consumer Complaint , wherein she has admitted that the Appellant - Builder had obtained the Completion Certificate as late as April 2016 . The Respondent — Purchaser could not have any further grievance after April 2016 with respect to delay in handing over possession . The Respondent — Purchaser ought not to be allowed to reap the benefits of her own delay in taking possession . 7
