agriculturists and are entered as agricultural lands in the revenue records . The debtor applied to the revenue authorities for the conversion of these lands to non - agricultural lands which is pending till date due to policy decision . 40 . It is undisputed that these lands were mortgaged in favour of the creditor under a deed dated 26.02.2010 . Obviously , since no security interest can be created in respect of agricultural lands and yet it was so created , goes to show that the parties did not treat the land as agricultural land and that the debtor offered the land as security on this basis . The undisputed position is that the total land on which the Goa Hotel was located admeasures 182225 sq . mtrs . Of these , 2335 sq . mtrs . are used for growing vegetables , fruits , shrubs and trees for captive consumption of the hotel . There is no substantial evidence about the growing of vegetables but what seems to be on the land are some trees bearing curry leaves and coconut . This amounts to about 12.8 % of the total area . 41 . The Corporate Loan Agreement * ’ that deals with the mortgage in question in the relevant clause * ® reads as follows : “ The Borrower shall create mortgage on Exclusive basis on the ‘ Park Hyatt Goa Resort and Spa ” Hotel Property admeasuring 1 , 82 , 225 Sq Mtrs with a built up area of 25182 Sq .
