monies due to the banks and financial institutions can be recovered . ” In State Bank of India v. Santosh Gupta and Ors . * this Court concluded that the Act is referable to Entries 45 and 95 of List I. It observed that : " FS vsveces the entire Act , including Sections 17-A and 18-B , would in pith and substance be referable to Entries 45 and 95 of List I , .... ” 43 . The validity of Section 31(i ) which in any case deals with security interest created over agricultural land and not agricultural land itself , is an integral part of the Act and can not be questioned on the ground of legislative competence . In A.S. Krishna and Ors . v. State of Madras ™ this Court observed as follows : “ It would be quite an erroneous approach to the question to view such a statute not as an organic whole , but as a mere collection of sections , then disintegrate it into parts , examine under what heads of legislation those parts would severally fall , and by that process determine what portions thereof are intra vires , and what are not . ” Thus , this contention on behalf of the debtor must be rejected . 4 ° AIR 2017 SC 25 * AIR 1957 SC 297 27
