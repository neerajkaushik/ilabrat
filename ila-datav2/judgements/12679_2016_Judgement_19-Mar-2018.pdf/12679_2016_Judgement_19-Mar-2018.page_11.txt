21 . Rule 3A of the Rules requires the authorized officer who is an officer specified by the Board of Directors of the secured creditor to consider the representation and modify the notice of demand if satisfied of the need to do so in that regard . If the authorized officer comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not tenable or acceptable , he must communicate the reasons for non - acceptance of the representation or objection within fifteen days . 22 . The Act and the Rules thus provide for a locus poenitentiae . The borrower may raise an objection or make a representation of any nature that the creditor must consider , and if found not acceptable , may reject the same before proceeding to resort to any of the measures provided by Section 13(4 ) of the Act . The borrower may thus raise an objection against the proposed measures or make a representation explaining the circumstances in which he can not discharge his liabilities and propose reschedulement . This may result in reconsideration by the creditor of whether or not it would be prudent to carry out the proposed measures and may even result in a renovation of the contract . 23 . Sub - section ( 3A ) of Section 13 was introduced in the Act by the Parliament in pursuance of the following observations of this Court in Mardia2 Â° Chemicals : 20 ( 2004 ) 4 SCC 311 11
