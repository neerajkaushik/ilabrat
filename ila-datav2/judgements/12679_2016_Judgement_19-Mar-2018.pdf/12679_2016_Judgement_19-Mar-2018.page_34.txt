this kind taken up by an intending purchaser can not lead to an inference of collusion . Mainly , the finding is based on the fact that the sale is a collusion because the auction purchaser was aware that a dispute between the parties was pending and still went ahead and made a bid for the property . It is not unusual in the sale of immovable properties to come across difficulties in finding suitable buyers for the property . We find that the property was eventually sold on the fourth auction , and all the auctions were duly advertised . 53 . Another fact on the basis of which the High Court has observed an inference of collusion is that the property was sold and the sale was confirmed in favour of ITC Ltd. though a statement was made in the morning of 23.02.2015 before the DRT that the sale would not be confirmed till the order is passed . This seems to be recorded in the order of the DRT . However , what is overlooked is the fact that in the statement on behalf of the creditor , the creditor only agreed to not confirm the sale till 3 pm . In the absence of any finding as to what actually transpired , it is not possible for us to infer manipulation and collusion on this account . There is no dispute that the property was actually purchased by ITC Ltd. in pursuance of a public auction and that the entire amount of sale consideration has been deposited by it . 54 . We have anxiously considered the entire matter and find that the undisputed facts of the case are that a loan was taken by the debtor 34
