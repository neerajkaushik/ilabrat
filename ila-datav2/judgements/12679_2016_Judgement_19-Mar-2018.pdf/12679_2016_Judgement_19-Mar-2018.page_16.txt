introduced via sub - section ( 3A ) , it could not be the intention of the Parliament for the provision to be futile and for the discretion to ignore the objection / representation and proceed to take measures , be left with the creditor . There is a clear intendment to provide for a /ocus poenitentiae which requires an active consideration by the creditor and a reasoned order as to why the debtor ’s representation has not been accepted . 30 . Moreover , this provision provides for communication of the reasons for not accepting the representation / objection and the requirement to furnish reasons for the same . A provision which requires reasons to be furnished must be considered as mandatory . Such a provision is an integral part of the duty to act fairly and reasonably and not   fancifully . We are not prepared in such circumstances to interpret the silence of the Parliament in not providing for any consequence for non - compliance with a duty to furnish reasons . The provision must nonetheless be treated as ‘ mandatory ’ . We agree with the view of this Court in this regard in Mardia Chemicals Ltd. v. Union of India * ® , Transcore v. Union of India * ® and Keshavlal Khemchand & Sons ( P ) Ltd. v. Union of India ’ ’ . 25 ( 2004 ) 4 SCC 311 ( para 45 , 47 , 77 and 80 ) 26 ( 2008 ) 1 SCC 125 ( para 24 and 25 ) 27 ( 2015 ) 4 SCC 770 ( para 19 and 61 ) 16
