The submission that the letter was written without prejudice to the legal rights and remedies available under any law and therefore the acknowledgement or the undertaking has no legal effect must likewise be rejected . This letter is reminiscent of a letter that fell for consideration in Spencer ’s * * case as pointed out by Mr. Harish Salve , “ as a rule the debtor who writes such letters has no intention to bind himself further than is bound already , no intention of paying so long as he can avoid payment , and nothing before his mind but a desire , somehow or other , to gain time and avert pressure . ” It was argued in a subsequent case * ® that an acknowledgment made “ without prejudice ” in the case of negotiations can not be used as evidence of anything expressly or impliedly admitted . The House of Lords observed as follows : “ But when a statement is used as acknowledgement for the purpose of s. 29 ( 5 ) , it is not being used as evidence of anything . The statement is not an evidence of an acknowledgement . It is the acknowledgement . ” Therefore , the without prejudice rule could have no application . It said : 34 Spencer v.
