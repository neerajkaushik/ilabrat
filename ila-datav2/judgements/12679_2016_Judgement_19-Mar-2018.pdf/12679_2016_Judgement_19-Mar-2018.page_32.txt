" The section ( s.8 ) does not apply to court sales , for such sales effect a transfer by the operation of law . The principle of the section was , however , applied in a case decided by Madras High Court where a debt for unpaid purchase money on a sale of land was attached and sold , and the auction purchaser was held entitled to the charge which the vendor had under s 55(4 ) ( b ) on the property in the hands of the buyer . The court , after observing that the present section did not apply to court sales , said : The effect of applying s 8 is to strengthen the sale certificate by transferring the lien along with it . ” This Court observed in Abdul Aziz * ? that a sale through court is different from a sale inter parties : “ What is sold at a court sale is the right , title and interest of the judgment debtor , and the extent of that interest is a mixed question of fact and law to be decided according to the circumstances of each particular case , and depends upon what the court intended to sell , and the purchaser intended to buy . ” We note that even though the entire right , title and interest were purported to have been transferred , all the rights , transfer and interest could not be said to have been transferred since the possession of the property was not transferred to creditor . The possession was retained by the debtor who continued to do business and receive rent from the rooms on the property and has in fact continued to do so till date . There is no doubt that after taking over the property from debtor , the creditor also acquired the right to receive the usufruct of the property i.e. the rent in this case . However , this was an interest in 49 Abdul Aziz v. Appayasami ( 1904 ) ILR 27 Mad 131 , 31 IA 1 . 32
