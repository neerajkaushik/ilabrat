acquitted of the offences and the acquittal was only based on the extension of benefit of doubt . Contention of the appellant is that the post of Constable in disciplinary force demands an impeccable integrity and track record besides good character and suitability . Further contention is that the court can not overreach the jurisdiction of the Screening Committee by substituting its own view in the decision of the said Committee and hence , the impugned judgment of the High Court and the Tribunal is not sustainable . 7 . Per contra , contention of the respondents is that the criminal case against the respondents was a case of ' no evidence ' and the acquittal of the respondents is an honourable acquittal and the same can not be termed to be the case of â€˜ benefit of doubt ' . Moreover , respondents had fairly disclosed the factum of facing criminal trial by giving complete details while applying for the job and there was no suppression on the part of the respondents . On behalf of the respondents , much reliance was placed upon Joginder Singh v. Union Territory of Chandigarh and others ( 2015 ) 2 SCC 377 . Page No . 5 of 15
