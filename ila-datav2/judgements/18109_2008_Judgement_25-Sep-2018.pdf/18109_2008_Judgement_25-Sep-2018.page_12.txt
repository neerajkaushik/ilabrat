owners intended to cultivate the land prior to 10 - 5 - 1971 . As the provision contained in subsection ( 3 ) of Section 3 of the 1971 Act clearly provides for exclusion of the operation of sub - section ( 1 ) thereof , the same has to be construed liberally . So construed , the conduct of the parties was a relevant fact . The High Court , in our opinion , therefore was not correct in ignoring the findings of the Tribunal . Also , the High Court should bestow its attention to the findings arrived at by the Tribunal having regard to the limited nature of the scope and ambit of appeal in terms of Section 8-A of the 1971 Act and , particularly , in view of the fact that the order dated 21 - 2 - 1979 had not been appealed against . ” 15 ) The matter was accordingly heard by the High Court after remand with a view to find out as to whether the findings recorded by the Tribunal are in conformity with the law laid down by this Court in Joseph ’s case ( supra ) . By impugned order , the State 's appeal was dismissed by the High Court which gives rise to filing of this appeal by way of special leave in this Court by the State . 12
