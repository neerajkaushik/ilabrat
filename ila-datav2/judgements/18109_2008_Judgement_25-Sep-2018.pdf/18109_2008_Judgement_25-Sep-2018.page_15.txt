22 ) In our opinion , the question as to what is true interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Act and especially Section 3(3 ) and the other question regarding holding of the land and its intended use by the respondents stand already decided by this Court in the earlier round of litigation in its order dated 10.05.2007 in Paras 18 and 19 quoted above . The State can not , therefore , be allowed to raise the same plea again in the second round of litigation after remand . This Court in paras 18 and 19 explained the object and purpose of Section 3(3 ) of the Act and then holding that such provision has to be construed liberally examined the facts of this very case and set aside the order of the High Court in the earlier round of litigation . The remand of the case to the High Court was to examine the issue in the light of interpretation made by this Court . 15
