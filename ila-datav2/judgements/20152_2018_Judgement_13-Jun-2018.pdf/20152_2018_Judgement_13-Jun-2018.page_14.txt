14 and intervenors whether they could suggest any alternate mechanism or point out any infirmity or fault in normalization formula so placed by Mr. V. Giri , learned Senior Advocate but no counsel could suggest any alternative or point out any infirmity . According to us , the normalization formula so suggested , in the circumstances , would be the best possible way to compensate and take care of the interest of those 4690 candidates . At the same time , it would also ensure that no prejudice is caused to rest of the candidates . The normalization formula proceeds on the basis of answering efficiency or capacity of a candidate to answer questions in given time and then applies his rate of success as a parameter . Normally , a candidate would first answer those questions , whose answers he is well aware of and leave out rest to be answered in the end . His success rate in the former part would certainly be greater , as compared to the latter . Since he would be given benefit at the same success rate , there would be no prejudice . It is true that repeated interruptions would cause mental stress and upset him . But that aspect as a factor is difficult to be translated in a quantifiable parameter . Given the circumstances , the normalization formula appears to be the correct and appropriate methodology . We , therefore , accept the formula so suggested and reject the contention of outright cancellation of the entire test .
