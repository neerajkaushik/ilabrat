word change of opinion implies formulation of opinion and then a change thereof . In terms of assessment proceedings , it means formulation of belief by an assessing officer resulting from what he thinks on a particular question . It is a result of understanding , experience and reflection . 11 ) It is well settled and held by this court in a catena of judgments and it would be sufficient to refer Commissioner of Income Tax , Delhi vs. Kelvinator of India Ltd. ( 2010 ) 320 ITR 561(SC ) wherein this Court has held as under : “ S .... where the Assessing Officer has reason to believe that income has escaped assessment , confers jurisdiction to re- open the assessment . Therefore , post - lst April , 1989 , power to re - open is much wider . However , one needs to give a schematic interpretation to the words " reason to believe " ..... Section 147 would give arbitrary powers to the Assessing Officer to re - open assessments on the basis of " mere change of opinion " , which can not be per se reason to re - open . 6 . We must also keep in mind the conceptual difference between power to review and power to re - assess . The Assessing Officer has no power to review ; he has the power to re - assess . But re - assessment has to be based on fulfillment of certain pre - condition and if the concept of " change of opinion " is removed , as contended on behalf of the Department , then , in the garb of re - opening the assessment , review would take place . 7 . One must treat the concept of " change of opinion " as an in - built test to check abuse of power by the Assessing Officer . Hence , after 1st April , 1989 , Assessing Officer has power to re - open , provided there is " tangible material " to come to the conclusion that there is escapement of income from assessment . Reasons must have a live link with the formation of the belief . ”
