Section 10A of the IT Act was well considered in the original assessment proceedings itself . Hence , initiation of the re - assessment proceedings under Section 147 by issuing a notice under Section 148 merely because of the fact that now the Assessing Officer is of the view that the deduction under Section 10A was allowed in excess , was based on nothing but a change of opinion on the same facts and circumstances which were already in his knowledge even during the original assessment proceedings . 14 ) In light of the forgoing discussion , we are of the view that impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 24.02.2006 does not call for any interference . The appeal is accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs . vecestssestessestsseseestesseestessessesestess J. ( R.K. AGRAWAL ) se MesieeeED qureNEM ERNE MEMES auIvEINTNS euEURY J. ( MOHAN M.
