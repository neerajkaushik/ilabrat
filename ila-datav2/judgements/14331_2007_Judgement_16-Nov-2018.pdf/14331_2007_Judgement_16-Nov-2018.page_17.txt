17 of the suit property in any other capacity , and in that view of the matter , we fail to understand as to how Md. Sattar @ Mokhan , or any person claiming through him , could be permitted to question the validity of the sale certificate dated 7h August , 1965 issued by the Managing Officer in favour of respondent No.3 ( Mainmum Nissa @ Kumani ) . 13 . The appellant had placed emphasis on the finding rendered in the civil suit filed by the husband of respondent No.3 , for permanent injunction against respondent No.4 ( Md. Sattar @ Mokhan ) . However , we agree with the concurrent view taken by the authority concerned that the said finding will be of no avail to the appellant . For , respondent No.3 was not impleaded as a party in the said suit . 14 . Suffice it to observe that the appellant , having failed to produce the sale certificate in favour of respondent No.4 ( Md. Sattar @ Mokhan ) issued by the Custodian of Evacuee Property under the 1950 Act , he can not be heard to raise the issue of jurisdiction of the Managing Officer to deal with the subject property , including the validity of the sale certificate
