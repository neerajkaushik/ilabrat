5 original sale certificate dated 30 November , 1968 purportedly issued in favour of respondent No.4 ( Md. Sattar @ Mokhan ) , who had transferred the property to one Shri Vishwanath S / o Kukhekahar who in turn transferred the same to Ram Abhilakh S / o Parmananad , R / o Shahganj , District Jaunpur , from whom the appellant claims to have acquired the same . 5 . Inthe present appeal , the appellant has contended that if an Indian citizen had left India to live in Pakistan , his property would become an evacuee property as defined in Section 2(f } of the 1950 Act ; and whence the Custodian alone would have the power under Section 10 of the 1950 Act to transfer such property in the manner prescribed by the 1950 Act . Further , such evacuee property could indeed be acquired under Section 12 of the Displaced Persons ( Compensation and Rehabilitation ) Act , 1954 by the Central Government , consequent to which the property would lose the status of an evacuee property and the Custodian would be divested of its power to deal with the same . That property would then become a part of the compensation pool as envisaged under Section 14
