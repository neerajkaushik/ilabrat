further suffer rigorous imprisonment for a period of six months . All the aggrieved accused persons , including the appellant herein , carried the matter by way of separate appeals before the High Court . By an elaborate judgment which is impugned herein , the High Court dismissed the appeal affirming the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court . That is how the accused Raju Manjhi is in appeal before us . At the outset , we would like to record that whenever this appeal came up for hearing before us , learned counsel for the appellant remained absent . Therefore , in the interest of justice , we directed the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee to appoint an advocate to defend the case of appellant . In accordance therewith , Ms. Nidhi , learned counsel appeared and argued on behalf of the appellant . We have heard learned counsel appearing for the parties on either side and carefully perused the material available on record .
