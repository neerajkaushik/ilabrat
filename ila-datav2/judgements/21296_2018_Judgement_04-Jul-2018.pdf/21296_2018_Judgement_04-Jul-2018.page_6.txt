In the companion matter namely Civil Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition ( Civil ) No.14972 of 2018 , we have adverted to certain decisions of this Court where the propriety and correctness of similar such interim directions had been questioned before this Court .

JSS Medical College ’ , ( iii ) Medical Council of India v. Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences ( KIMS ) ’ * , ( iv ) Dental Council of India v. Dr. Hedgewar Smruti Rugna Seva Mandal Hingoli and Others * , we have held in the companion matter that there was no justification for passing interim directions and permitting the concerned College to go ahead with provisional admissions for the academic session 2018 - 2019 . We have further held that any stipulation that the admissions pursuant to such interim directions shall be subject to the result of the petition would not be a sufficient protection or insulation and such orders result in tremendous prejudice to the students . 1(2004 ) 6 SCC 76 2 ( 2012 ) 5 SCC 628 3 ( 2016 ) 11 SCC 530 4 ( 2017 ) 13 SCC 115
