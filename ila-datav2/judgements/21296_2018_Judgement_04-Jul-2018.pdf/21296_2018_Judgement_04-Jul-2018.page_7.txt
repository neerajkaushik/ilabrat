7 We have further held that if a case is made out the proper course is to hear the matter finally rather than passing interim directions as have been passed in the present matter . Based on same reasoning , we hold that the High Court was not justified in passing the order under challenge . 9 . We , therefore , allow this appeal and set aside the order dated 29.05.2018 passed by the High Court . Since the matter is to come up on 09.07.2018 before the High Court , the entire controversy can be gone into . We have not dealt with factual controversy in the present matter and the facts that have been set out in the preceding paragraphs are only by way of narration of events . We are sure that the pending matter will be considered purely on merits . 10 . With these observations , the present appeal is allowed and the order under appeal is set aside . No costs .
