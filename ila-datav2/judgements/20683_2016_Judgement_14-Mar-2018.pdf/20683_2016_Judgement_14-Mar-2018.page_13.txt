13 genetic counselling centres , laboratories and clinics . The wisdom of the legislature in adopting the policy can not be substituted by the court in the exercise of the power of judicial review . Prima facie the judgment of the Delhi High Court has trenched upon an area of legislative policy . Judicial review can not extend to reappreciating the efficacy of a legislative policy adopted ina law which has been enacted by the competent legislature . Both the Indian Medical Council Act , 1956 and the PCPNDT Act are enacted by Parliament . Parliament has the legislative competence to do so . The Training Rules 2014 were made by the Central Government in exercise of the power conferred by Parliament . Prima facie , the rules are neither ultra vires the parent legislation nor do they suffer from manifest arbitrariness . 11 For the reasons that we have indicated , we are of the view that the judgment of the Delhi High Court needs to be stayed during the pendency of these proceedings . The judgment of the High Court squarely impinges upon the directions issued by this Court in Voluntary Health Association of Punjab . We direct in consequence that the judgment of this Court in Voluntary Health Association of Punjab shall be strictly enforced by all states and union territories untrammelled by any order of any High Court or any other court .
