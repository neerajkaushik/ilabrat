11 demand and supply ratio must have been upset . The appellant would therefore be entitled to some benefit on that count . 14 . Considering the entirety of the matter , in our view , instead of direction No.3 issued by the Commission , a lumpsum payment of Rs.5 lakhs in substitution of said direction , would meet the ends of justice . We , therefore , modify the directions issued by the Commission . Retaining directions 1 , 2 & 4 , the direction No.3 is substituted and in its place the appellant would be required to pay a lumpsum compensation of Rs.5 lakhs to the respondent in respect of each case . We direct that all the sums covered by the directions shall be made over within 2 months from today failing which the respondent complainant shall be entitled to 8 % interest on the amounts in question . 15 . With these directions civil appeals stand disposed of . No costs . ( Uday Umesh Lalit ) bie ee de deeeceeeeneeeeneeneenes J. ( R. Subhash Reddy ) New Delhi , November 27 , 2018
