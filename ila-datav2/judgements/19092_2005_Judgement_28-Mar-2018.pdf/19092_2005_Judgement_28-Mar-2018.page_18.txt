18 15 . The only other issue that remains to be addressed is about the amount of earnest money paid by the impleaded respondent N & S Resorts by way of banker â€™s cheque dated 27th June , 2005 in the sum of Rs.10 lakhs . Since the tender process in which the impleaded respondent had participated , was subject to the outcome of the pending legal proceedings , no right would accrue to it in the stated premises except to get refund of the amount paid as earnest money for participating in the Court directed tender process . The amount so paid by the impleaded respondent shall be refunded to it , with interest at the rate of 9 % per annum ( equivalent to the bank rate for fixed deposits prevailing at the time the deposit was made ) from the date of deposit till its realization . The Municipal Corporation shall forthwith refund such amount to the impleaded respondent N & S Resorts but not later than twelve weeks from today , failing which the Municipal Corporation shall be liable to pay interest at the rate of 12 % per annum from the date of deposit till the date of its realization .
