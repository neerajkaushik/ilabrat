offence under Section 302 and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs.5000/- each and in default of payment to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of 2 years each . The judgment passed by the trial Court was subsequently challenged before the High Court . The High Court also confirmed the sentence and conviction passed by the trial Court . In the present case there were as many as five accused . A-5 was acquitted by the trial Court itself . The other two accused A-2 and A-3 had filed Special leave Petition ( Criminal ) No(s ) . 2572 - 2573 of 2009 against the judgment and order of the High Court , which were dismissed by this Court at the time of admission itself . In criminal cases , it is well settled that a dismissal of a SLP in limine , would neither mean that the lower court judgment stands affirmed nor the principle res judicata would be applicable [ refer Kunhayammed and Anr . v. State of Kerala , AIR 2000 SC 2587 ; State of Punjab v. Devinder Pal Singh Bhullar , AIR 2012 SC 364 ] . Therefore , the dismissal of the SLP of the co - accused will not have any effect accordingly .
