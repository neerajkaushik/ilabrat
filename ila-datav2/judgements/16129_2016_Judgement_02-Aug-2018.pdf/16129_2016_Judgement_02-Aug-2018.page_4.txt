on the fact that all the promotions given to the incumbents were ad _ hoc . Therefore , when a _ final seniority list is to be drawn up , a call has to be taken as to the fate of the ad hoc promotions . In our view , the view taken by the Tribunal , as affirmed by the High Court , can not be faulted since 97 incumbents could not have occupied the positions on regular basis , since it was in excess of the eligible quota . 6 . We have ascertained that there can not be more than two incumbents out of 61 in office as of now . Having regard to the decades of service rendered by them , we direct that they shall not be reverted in the process of implementation of the judgment . It is also directed that the incumbents who have already retired from service shall not be disturbed as far as their pension is concerned . 7 . We make it clear that in the _ process ’ of implementation of the impugned judgment , in case any of the individual incumbents has any other grievance , it will be open to him / her to pursue the same in appropriate proceedings . 8 . Subject to the ’ above , these appeals ’ are dismissed .
