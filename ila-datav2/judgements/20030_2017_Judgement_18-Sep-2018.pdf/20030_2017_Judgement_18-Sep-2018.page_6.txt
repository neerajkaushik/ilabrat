High Court of Orissa granting the order of bail in favour of the respondent was passed as far back as 16.05.2017 , the respondent was actually released from custody with effect from May 2018 , inasmuch as he was in custody in two other cases till then . 9 . The High Court proceeded to grant bail to the respondent on the ground that there is no prima facie material against the respondent to establish his involvement in the conspiracy to murder the deceased , that the undated letter of the deceased addressed to the police showing apprehension to his life can not be treated as a dying declaration ; the material on record does not indicate any motive on the part of the respondent to conspire towards the commission of murder in question , and that the confessions of the co - accused can not be made used of against the respondent at this stage , inasmuch as they are admissible only to the extent that they lead to recoveries under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act . 10 . Since the investigation is yet to complete and trial is yet to begin , it would not be proper for us to dwell upon the subject
