it is open for this Court to set aside the order of the High Court , where it is apparent that the High Court has not exercised its discretion judiciously and in accordance with the basic principles governing the grant of bail . ( See the judgment of this Court in the case of Neeru Yadav vs. state of Uttar Pradesh , ( 2014 ) 16 SCC 508 and Prasanta Kumar Sarkar vs. Ashis Chatterjee , ( 2010 ) 14 SCC 496 ) . It is by now well settled that at the time of considering an application for bail , the Court must take into account certain factors such as the existence of a prima facie case against the accused , the gravity of the allegations , position and status of the accused , the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice and repeating the offence , the possibility of tampering with the witnesses and obstructing the Courts as well as the criminal antecedents of the accused . It is also well settled that the Court must not go into deep into merits of the matter while considering an application for bail . All that needs to be established from the record is the existence of a prima facie case against the accused . ( See the judgment of this Court in the case of Anil Kumar Yadav vs. State ( NCT ) of Delhi , ( 2018 ) 12 SCC 129 . )
