From her deposition it is clear that on 11 - 10 - 2003 there was no talk about the dowry problem . Hence , in such a case , in the absence of the letter sent to the Chief Minister ’s Cell having been filed before this Court , the defence theory has to be accepted to the effect that in the letter sent to the Chief Minister ’s Cell there was no reference about the dowry problem and the enquiry at the police station also was not on dowry problem and to that much extent the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused relating to dowry problem . As such , the evidence of PWs 26 and 27 in no way show that there was any talk regarding dowry problem . In such a case there is force in the contention of the defence side that the problem between the parties is not mainly centered on dowry , even though as per the evidence discussed supra there were talks about the gold jewels and payment of money . ” 6 .
