a transfer petition , which will always have to be decided on the facts of each case . Convenience of a party may be one of the relevant considerations but can not override all other considerations such as the availability of witnesses exclusively at the original place , making it virtually impossible to continue with the trial at the place of transfer , and progress of which would naturally be impeded for that reason at the transferred place of trial . The convenience of the parties does not mean the convenience of the petitioner alone who approaches the court on misconceived notions of apprehension . Convenience for the purposes of transfer means the convenience of the prosecution , other accused , the witnesses and the larger interest of the society . The charge sheet in FIR No.351 of 2016 reveals that of the 40 witnesses , the petitioner alone is from Mumbai , two are from Ghaziabad , and one is from NOIDA . The charge sheet of FIR No.1742 of 2016 is not on record . A reasonable presumption can be drawn that the position would be similar in the same also .
