12 provisions of Section 84 and , consequently , Sections 98(c ) and 101(b ) of the Act are concerned , although a casual vacancy may have occurred within the meaning of Section 150 of the Act . The Court made a distinction between the two categories of vacancies , namely , vacancies in which election petitions had been filed and are pending and other vacancies where no such cases were filed and pending . The Court opined that in the first category of cases , the vacancies could not have been treated to be available for the purposes of filling up within the time prescribed under Section 151A of the Act merely because a member of the House of a Legislature of a State had resigned and the same had been accepted by the Speaker . To arrive at the said conclusion , emphasis was laid on Section 84 of the Act . In the second category of cases , the Court pronounced that the vacancies would have to be construed as clear vacancies warranting action under Section 151A of the Act . 15 .
