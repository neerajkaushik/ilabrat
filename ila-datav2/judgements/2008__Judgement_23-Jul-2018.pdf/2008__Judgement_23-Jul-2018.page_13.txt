13 Act can not be understood to mean , as has been held by the learned Appellate Tribunal , that the provisions of the Act of 1948 which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the 2003 Act so far as the determination of tariff is concerned would continue to hold the field . Two principal basis have been urged in support of the above . The first is that a proviso can not be understood to go beyond the main part of the Section which , in the present case , deals only with ‘ licensing ’ and not ‘ tariff determination ’ . Reliance in this regard has been placed on the decisions of this Court in Dwaraka Prasad vs. Dwarka Das Saraf * and Union of India & Ors . vs. Dileep Kumar Singh ? . The second limb of the argument is based on the provisions contained in Section 174 of the 2003 Act which gives an overriding effect to the provisions of the 2003 Act notwithstanding any inconsistency with any other law for the time being in force . 1 ( 1976 ) 1 SCC 128 [ para 18 ] 2 ( 2015 ) 4 SCC 421 [ para20 ]
