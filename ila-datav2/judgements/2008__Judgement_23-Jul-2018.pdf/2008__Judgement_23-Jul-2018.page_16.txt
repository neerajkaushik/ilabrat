It is on the same basis that the findings of the learned Appellate Tribunal so far as the ‘ Sinking Fund ’ is concerned , which has been held to be recoverable through the tariff , has been assailed .

Similarly , the finding of the learned Appellate Tribunal with regard to the allowability of charging the expenditure on projects other than electricity from the common fund as common expenditure has been assailed as being contrary to the spirit of the 2003 Act inasmuch as it is opposed to the principle of allowance of cross - subsidy which the 2003 Act seeks to do away with . Reference has been made to different provisions of the 2003 Act to contend that recovery of expenditure unrelated to electricity generation from the electricity tariff is alien and contrary to the provisions of the 2003 Act .
