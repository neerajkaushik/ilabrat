51 54 . Insofar as the consumers ( appellants in Civil Appeal Nos . 971 - 973 of 2008 ) are concerned , an additional issue has been struck , as noticed earlier . This is with regard to the number of employees engaged in the power sector by the Corporation for whom alone proportionate recovery by way of tariff so far as the pension and gratuity is concerned , would be justifiable . Apart from the fact that the issue was not raised in any of the forums below and had been so raised before this Court for the first time and that too in the course of the arguments advanced , the materials on record do not justify a conclusion to be reached by us which will support the core basis of the contention made , namely , that the Corporation had not laid before the CERC any materials to show the extent of the work - force deployed in the power sector of the Corporation . In fact , in the counter arguments advanced on behalf of the Corporation this contention has been refuted and it is asserted that such materials were , indeed , laid before the CERC , a fact which we find to be correct .
