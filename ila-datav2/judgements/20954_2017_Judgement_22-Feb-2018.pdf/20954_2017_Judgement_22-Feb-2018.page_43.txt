alteration of the limits of the port can not possibly be said to affect the Appellants ’ rights qua reclaimed land , which has been reclaimed illegally i.e. without prior permission under the Gujarat Maritime Board Act . Thus , the CRZ clearance by the Ministry of Environment and Forests dated 6 " May , 2014 for reclamation of 334 hectares of land does not further the Appellants ’ case in any way . 23 . We now come to the Appellants ’ argument of the haste that is shown by the GMB in recommending the second proposal for altered limits . True , the GMB did act within 4 days of the said proposal , but this fact , without anything more , to demonstrate mala fides or lack of public interest , can not possibly hold water . It is also to be noted that Shri Salve ’s plea , that 13 berths would require 1011 hectares of adjacent land and that much less land than 1011 hectares has been allocated for the use of a commercial port , has to be accepted . 43
