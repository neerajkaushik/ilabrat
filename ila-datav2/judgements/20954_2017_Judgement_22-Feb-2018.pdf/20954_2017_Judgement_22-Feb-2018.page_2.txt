State Government of Gujarat expanded the port limits of Hazira port . It is the case of the Appellants before us that by doing so , the Appellants have been affected because they have spent huge monies on lands reclaimed by them , which would be directly affected by the expansion of the aforesaid port limits . 3 : The brief facts necessary for determining the questions that arise in this appeal are as follows . In 1994 , the parent company of the Appellants entered into an agreement with the Gujarat Maritime Board ( hereinafter referred to as “ GMB ” ) for use of a captive jetty in Magdalla port . Pursuant to a Port Policy framed by the Government of Gujarat in 1995 , and a Build , Own , Operate and Transfer ( BOOT ) Policy framed for private sector participation in development of the State ’s ports in 1997 , the GMB issued a Global Notice for Expression of Interest for Development of Green Field Site Port Facilities , inviting bids in the name of Hazira port project .
