anchorage of such vessels , but also for reasons of customs formalities , port conversion , general security etc . We are not , therefore , satisfied that the notification is ultra vires Section 5 of the Indian Ports Act . We have already seen that the Appellants have no ‘ right ’ to private property in view of the fact that the ownership of the captive jetty that has been constructed and the ownership of reclaimed land is with the GMB / State Government . For this reason also , the notification is intra vires as the alteration in the limits of Hazira Port does not affect any ‘ right ’ of the Appellants to private property . 26 . In conclusion , for the reasons given by us in the present judgment , the appeal deserves to be dismissed . The appeal is dismissed with no order as to costs . be ceeeeeeeceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees J.
