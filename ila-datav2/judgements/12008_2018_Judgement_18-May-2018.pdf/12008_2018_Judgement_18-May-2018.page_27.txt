27 2018 in M.A. No.934/2018 about the reasons which were beyond the control of the appropriate authority dealing with framing of the scheme , we do not wish to continue the contempt action any further . For the same reason , the directions sought in I.As . filed by the concerned party also need not detain us . For , the corrected draft scheme is in consonance with the dictum and directions in the Award as modified by this Court and also in conformity with Section 6A of the 1956 Act . The draft scheme ought to be taken forward to its logical end in accordance with law with utmost dispatch . 20 . In view of the above , we dispose of all the I.As . , M.As . and the contempt petitions by this common order , on accepting the assurance given on behalf of the Union of India that the draft scheme will be taken to its logical end in accordance with law , with utmost dispatch . We hope and trust that the draft scheme reproduced in paragraph 12 above , is notified in the Official Gazette and given effect to with promptitude before the onset of the impending monsoon .
