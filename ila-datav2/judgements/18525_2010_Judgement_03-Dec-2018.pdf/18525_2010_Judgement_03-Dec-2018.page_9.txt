tariff is the interest on loan and not the repayment of loan . The interest being computed on the outstanding during the financial year when the loan gets repaid in a progressive manner , the loan gets reduced and therefore the amount of interest to be allowed in the tariff towards the loan is lessened . Till the enactment of the Act of 2003 and the transition period allowed till 1.4.2006 , the entire capital cost has to be treated as equity alone . There can not be a loan and therefore there can not be repayment of loan or progressive reduction of loan reducing the outstanding loan to be serviced through interest on loan among other things . It is contended that these implications would be from 1.4.2006 . Reference is made to Section 30 and 32 of the DVC Act . It is contended that the entire capital of the DVC was to be treated as equity . The capital cost as on 1.4.2006 should have been considered to be the total amount of gross fixed asset . This cost was to be totally divided to debt and equity for generating project at the rate of 50:50 established prior to 30.3.1992 and at the rate of 70:30 for generation project established after 30.03.1992 .
