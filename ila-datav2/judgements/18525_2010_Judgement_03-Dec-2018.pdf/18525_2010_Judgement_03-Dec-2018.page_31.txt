this Court in 2007 ( 3 ) SCC 33 , there the question which really arose was related to the rate of depreciation . This Court took the view for power companies keeping in view the need to replace the assets , a higher rate of depreciation was necessary as it would reduce the number of years required for replacing the assets . The observation made therein incidentally may not have the effect which the appellant seeks to persuade us to accept . But the question would be whether the appellant would be entitled to raise the complaint in this appeal . In the original order passed on 3.10.2006 by the Central Commission , the Commission held as follows :   57 . Majority of the loans raised by the petitioner Corporation are not project specific . The normative loan outstanding for individual station , as on 31.3.2004 , has been computed by applying the normative debt - equity structure of 70:30 ( as mentioned above ) to the capital cost with weighted average rate of interest of the loan for the petitioner Corporation as a whole . The cumulative depreciation as on 31.3.2004 or notional loan amount , whichever is lower , has been deemed as loan repayment and balance amount , if any , has been allowed to be serviced till itis fully repaid . Annual depreciation amount has been treated as normative loan repayment . 31
