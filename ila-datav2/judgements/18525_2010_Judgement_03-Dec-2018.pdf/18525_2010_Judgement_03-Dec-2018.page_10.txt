The Tribunal had gone wrong in holding that there was deemed repayment of the above loan in the past years prior to 1.4.2006 on the basis of cumulative depreciation of the assets in the past . The tariff regulation of 2004 for the period 1.4.2004 to 31.3.2009 though relevant , does not provide for any such adjustment of cumulative depreciation towards repayment of loan . In this regard , appellant relies on orders passed by the Appellate Tribunal in the case of NTPC which took the view that cumulative depreciation can not be treated as deemed repayment of loan . Reference is also placed on the judgment of this Court in the case of Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission Vs . BSES Yamuna Power Limited & Others 2007 ( 3 ) SCC 33 for the proposition that depreciation is not repayment of loan and therefore , by the cumulative depreciation , the quantum of loan can not be reduced . Yet it is pointed out that the Commission has applied the concept of cumulative depreciation as resulting in deemed repayment for the period prior to 31.3.2006 , which is impermissible . 10
