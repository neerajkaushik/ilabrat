by the paper - setter and accepted by the University as correct , should not be allowed to be challenged . One way of achieving it is not to publish the key answer at all . If the University had not published the key answer along with the result Sof the Test , no controversy would have arisen in this case . But that is not a correct way of looking at these matters which involve the future of hundreds of students who are aspirants for admission to professional courses . If the key answer were kept secret in this case , the remedy would have been worse than the disease because , so many students would have had to suffer the injustice in silence . The publication of the key answer has unravelled an unhappy state of affairs to which the University and the State Government must find a solution . Their sense of fairness in publishing the key answer has given them an opportunity to have a closer look at the system of examinations which they conduct . What has failed is not the computer but the human system . 16.Shri Kacker , who appears on behalf of the University , contended that no challenge should be allowed to be made to the correctness of a key answer unless , on the face of it , it is wrong . We agree that the key answer should be assumed to be correct unless it is proved to be wrong and that it should not be held to be wrong by an inferential process of reasoning or by a process of rationalisation . It must be clearly demonstrated to be wrong , that is to say , it must be such as no reasonable body of men well - versed in the particular subject would regard as correct . The contention of the University is falsified in this 14
