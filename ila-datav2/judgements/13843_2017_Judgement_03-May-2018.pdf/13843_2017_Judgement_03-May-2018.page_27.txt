27 who have already been selected . We , thus , are of the view that the Commission should revise the entire result of all the candidates except those who have been selected on the basis of the report of Expert Committee and publish revise result of all the candidates . When the key answers are correct of the candidates who appeared in the examination , they are entitled for revision of their result , since , fault does not lie with the candidates but lies with the examination body . It shall not be equitable to not extend the benefit to those candidates who have not come to the Court being satisfied with the steps taken by the Commission and its earlier Expert Committee which was given the task of revising the key answers . 24 . In view of the foregoing discussions , we dispose of these appeals with the following directions : ( 1 ) The Rajasthan Public Service Commission is directed to revise the result of all the candidates including all the appellants on the basis of Report of the Expert Committee constituted in pursuance of our order dated 16.01.2018 and publish the revised result .
