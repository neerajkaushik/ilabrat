37 . Insofar as the direction to initiate the prosecution under Sections 193 , 195 and 211 IPC is concerned , Section 340 Cr . P.C. provides the procedure for offences enumerated in Section 195(1 ) ( b ) Cr . P.C. The object of Section 340 Cr . P.C. is to ascertain whether any offence affecting administration of justice has been committed in relation to any document produced or evidence given in court during the time when the document or evidence was in custodian legis and whether it is also expedient in the interest of justice to take such action as required under Section 340 Cr . P.C. 38 . Before directing the prosecution to be initiated under Section 195 Cr . P.C. , the court has to follow the procedure under Section 340 Cr . P.C. and record a finding that “ it is expedient in the interest of justice ........ ” . Though wide discretion is given to court under Section 340 Cr . P.C. , the same has to be exercised with care and caution . To initiate prosecution under Section 195 Cr . P.C too readily that too against the police officials who were conducting the investigation may not be a correct approach . Contention of the learned counsel for the police officials is that before passing the direction to initiate the prosecution for the offences under Sections 193 , 195 and 211 IPC , the High Court ought to have followed the procedure contemplated under Section 340(1 ) Cr .
