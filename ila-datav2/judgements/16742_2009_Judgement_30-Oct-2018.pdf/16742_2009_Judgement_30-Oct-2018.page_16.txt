1 SCC 283 ] . It is well - settled by a catena of decisions of this Court that there is no rule of law or practice that the evidence of the prosecutrix can not be relied upon without corroboration and as such it has been laid down that corroboration is not a sine qua non for conviction in a rape case . If the evidence of the victim does not suffer from any basic infirmity and the ‘ probabilities factor ’ does not render it unworthy of credence , as a general rule , there is no reason to insist on corroboration except from medical evidence , where , having regard to the circumstances of the case , medical evidence can be expected to be forthcoming . [ State v. N.K. The accused ( 2000 ) 5 SCC 30 ] 25 . The trial court which had the opportunity of seeing and observing the prosecutrix , found the testimony of the prosecutrix reliable being corroborated by her mother ’s evidence , medical evidence , FSL report and other circumstances viz . absence of motive for any false implication etc . While so , the High Court ought not to have heavily interfered with the verdict of conviction based on the alleged time gap in the registration of two FIRs and other aspects of investigation in connection with FIR No.558/97 to reverse the verdict of conviction . 16
