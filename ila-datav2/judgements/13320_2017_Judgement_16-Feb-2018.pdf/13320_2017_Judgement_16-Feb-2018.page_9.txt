15 . It is an admitted fact that the premium was paid on 29.09.2008 . That it was only in 18.01.2011 that the respondent insurance company informed the appellant that the policy was not accepted by them . We are unable to fathom the reason for such excessive delay in informing the appellant , which can not be excused . We are of the opinion that the rejection of the policy must be made in a reasonable time so as to be fair and in consonance with the good faith standards . In this case , we can not hold that such enormous delay was reasonable . Moreover , it is borne from the records that the premium was only re - paid on 24.02.2011 , after a delay of more than one year five months . If we consider above aspects , it can be reasonably concluded that the insurer is only trying to get out of the bargain , which they had willfully accepted . From the aforesaid circumstances we can easily conclude that the policy was accepted by the insurer . 16 . In the circumstances , there is no reason to believe that there was no complete contract . There is clear presumption of the acceptance of the proposal in favour of the proposer . Therefore , the majority view of the Commission would not sustain . 17 . In the result , the appeal succeeds and is accordingly allowed . The order of the National Commission dated 22.11.2016 is hereby set aside and the order of the State Commission dated 16.7.2012 is restored .
