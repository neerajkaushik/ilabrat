12 . Our attention has been drawn to the case of LIC v. Raja Vasireddy Komalavalli Kamba and Ors . , ( 1984 ) 2 SCC 719 , wherein this Court has clearly stated that the acceptance of an insurance contract may not be completed by mere retention of the premium or preparation of the policy document rather the acceptance must be signified by some act or acts agreed on by the parties or from which the law raises a presumption of acceptance . 13 . Although we do not have any quarrel with the proposition laid therein , it should be noted that aforesaid judgments only laid down a flexible formula for the court to see as to whether there was clear indication of acceptance of the insurance . It is to be noted that the impugned majority order merely cites the aforesaid judgment , without appreciating the circumstances which give rise to a very clear presumption of acceptance of the policy by the insurer in this case at hand . The insurance contract being a contract of utmost good faith , is a two - way door . The standards of conduct as expected under the utmost good faith obligation should be met by either party to such contract . 14 . From the aforesaid clause it may be seen that the condition precedent for acceptance of the premium was the medical examination . It would be logical for an underwriter to accept the premium based on the medical examination and not otherwise . Therefore , by the very fact that they accepted the premium waived the condition precedent of medical examination .
