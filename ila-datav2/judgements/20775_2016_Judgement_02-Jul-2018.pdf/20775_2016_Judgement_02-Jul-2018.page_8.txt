crime , in the sense laid down by Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code : the accused may rebut it by placing before the court all the relevant evidence oral , documentary or circumstantial , but the burden of proof upon him is no higher than that rests upon a party to civil proceedings . ( 3 ) Even if the accused was not able to establish conclusively that he was insane at the time he committed the offence , the evidence placed before the court by the accused or by the prosecution may raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence , including mens rea of the accused and in that case the court would be entitled to acquit the accused on the ground that the general burden of proof resting on the prosecution was not discharged . ‚Äù 11 . Section 84 of the IPC carves out an exception , that an act will not be an offence , if done by a person , who at the time of doing the same , by reason of unsoundness of mind , is incapable of knowing the nature of the act , or what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law . But this onus on the accused , under Section 105 of the Evidence Act is not as stringent as on the prosecution to be established beyond all reasonable doubts . The accused has only to establish his defence on a preponderance of probability , as observed in Surendra Mishra vs. State of Jharkhand , ( 2011 ) 11 SCC
