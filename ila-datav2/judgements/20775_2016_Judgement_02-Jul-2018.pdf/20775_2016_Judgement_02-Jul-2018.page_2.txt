Chandra Chauhan , when the latter tried to intervene . The appellant then tried to flee , throwing the sickle enroute , when he was apprehended by the villagers and handed over to the police . 3 . The Additional Sessions Judge , Akola rejected the defence plea for unsoundness of mind , citing insufficient evidence relying on the evidence of Dr. Sagar Srikant Chiddalwar ( C.W.1 ) that the appellant was not mentally sick and fit to face trial . The subsequent conduct of the appellant while in custody , his demeanour during the trial , were further relied upon to conclude that the appellant was conscious of his wrongful acts which were deliberate in nature , evident from the repeated assaults and running away from the place of occurrence after throwing the sickle . The High Court declined to interfere with the conviction . 4 . Ms. Aparna Jha appearing on behalf of the appellant urged that in absence of any mens rea , conviction under Section 302 I.P.C. was unsustainable , relying upon Dahyabhai Chhaganbhai Thakker vs. State of Gujarat , 2
