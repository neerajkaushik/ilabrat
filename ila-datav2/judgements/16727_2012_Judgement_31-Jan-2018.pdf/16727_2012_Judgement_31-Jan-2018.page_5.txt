The decision in Uma Devi does not advance the case of the petitioner . 8 . Insofar as the final submission of the petitioner to the effect that some persons were appointed as Technical Assistant ( ENT ) in May 2016 is concerned , we are of the view that the events of 2016 can not relate back to the events of 2010 when a decision was taken by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences not to extend the contract of the petitioner . The situation appears to have changed over the last six years and the petitioner can not take any advantage of the changed situation . There is no material on record to indicate what caused the change in circumstances , and merely because there was a change in circumstances , does not mean that the petitioner is entitled to any benefit . On the other hand , it might have been more appropriate for the petitioner to have participated in the walk - in interview so that he could also be considered for appointment as Technical Assistant ( ENT ) , but he chose not to do so . 9 . We find no merit in these petitions and they are accordingly dismissed . ( Madan B. Lokur ) ( Deepak Gupta ) New Delhi ; January 31,2018 S.L.P. ( C ) Nos . 22475 - 22476 of 2012 Page 5 of 5
