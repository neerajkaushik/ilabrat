from the date of order . Ultimately the Court has decreed the suit . The unsatisfied defendants carried the matter in appeal which is numbered as Civil Appeal No.617/163/1982 . The lower appellate court having concurred with regard to the findings on the Will has taken a different view on the relationship of the plaintiffs with Jagan Nath and held that “ Exhibit PX ” does not prove the relationship of the plaintiffs and the Trial Court erred in relying on the admission of the defendants in the other suit and accordingly set aside the Judgement and Decree of the Trial Court and consequently dismissed the suit . Aggrieved thereby , the plaintiffs carried the matter in second appeal to the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh and the High Court has held all the issues in favour of the plaintiffs and set aside the Judgment and decree of the first appellate court and decreed the suit . Thus the Trial Court Judgment and Decree was restored . Hence the appellants are before us in this appeal .
