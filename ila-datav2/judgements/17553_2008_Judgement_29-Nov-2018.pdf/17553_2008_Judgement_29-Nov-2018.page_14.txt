20 . 14 legal position or grave injustice has been done in view of nonconsideration of important piece of evidence . We are in total agreement with the Courts below that the defendants failed to prove the execution and genuineness of the Will and such a finding does not call for any interference from this Court . This issue is answered against the appellants / defendants . In response to Issue No.2 , on this aspect , the Trial Court has held that the plaintiffs could prove the relationship with Jagan Nath and they are entitled for possession of the suit schedule property . But the 1 * appellate Court has arrived at a different finding that the plaintiffs were not able to prove that they are granddaughters of Kirpo and whether Kirpo was real sister of Mangal who was father of Jagan Nath . On the contrary , High Court has observed that Jagan Nath was undisputedly owner of the suit property and when the Will in favour of defendants is not proved , then plaintiffs as cognates , inherited the suit property from Jagan Nath and became owner thereof and are therefore entitled to seek possession of the suit property from the defendants .
