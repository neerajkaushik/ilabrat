3 upon the circumstances : ( i ) The body of the deceased - Ramesh was recovered at the instance of the appellant - accused ; ( ii ) The appellant - accused was said to have sold three sheep to Lingaiah ( PW-5 ) who in turn had sold to Shaik Naseem ( PW-9 ) . On being enquired , Shaik Naseem ( PW-9 ) told that he purchased the sheep from Lingaiah ( PW-5 ) who in turn purchased the same from the appellant and the rest of the sheep were kept in the house of PW-8 , sister of the appellant -accused . ( 6 ) It is well settled that when a _ case ’ rests_- on circumstantial evidence , such evidence must satisfy three tests : ( i ) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn , must be cogently and firmly established ; ( ii ) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused ; ( iii ) the circumstances , taken cumulatively , should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else . [ Vide : S.D. Soni v. State of Gujarat , ( 1992 ) Supp 1 SCC 567 and Venkatesan v. State of Tamil Nadu ( 2008 ) 8 SCC 456 ] ( 7 ) In the light of the well - settled principles ’ of circumstantial evidence , the case of the prosecution needs to be examined whether the circumstances are established and that they form a complete chain in establishing the guilt of the accused .
