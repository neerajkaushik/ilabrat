D considered view this only circumstance by itself may not be sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused . It was also submitted on behalf of the appellant - accused that in his questioning under Section 313 Cr . P.C. the appellant - accused has denied making of any confessional statement and recovery of dead body of the deceased - Ramesh at his behest . It was further argued that recovery of the dead body of the deceased - Ramesh after two days of the occurrence also raises doubt about the prosecution ’ case . ( 10 ) The circumstance of recovery of the dead body on the basis of confession may indicate that the accused might have been involved in the incident . However , as held in Raj Kumar Singh alias Raju Alias Batya v. State of Rajasthan , ( 2013 ) 5 scc 722 that suspicion however grave but can not take the place of the proof . There is a wide gap between “ may be ” and “ must be ” . In the present case , the circumstance of recovery of the dead body allegedly based on the alleged confessional statement may raise a suspicion against the appellant - accused that he might be involved in the incident but mere suspicion itself can not take itself the evidence of proof . In our view conviction under Section 302/201 I.P.C. can not be sustained , more so , when the motive attributed for the murder has been theft of the sheep , and the accused - appellant has _ been acquitted of the charge of theft .
