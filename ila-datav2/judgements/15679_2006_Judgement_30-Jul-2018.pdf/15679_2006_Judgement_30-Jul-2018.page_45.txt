45 before the Court that the object of Section 5(2)(a)(iii ) of the relevant statute , was to give exemption not to the particular departments but to the sale of such goods to those departments and , therefore , sale of those goods made to any Departments of the Government of India , which came to be charged with the duty of purchasing those goods should also come within the purview of the exemption . The Court while repelling the aforesaid interpretation , reasoned as under : “ We are unable to accept this line of reasoning . This interpretation will unduly narrow the scope and ambit of the exemption by limiting it to sales of only those goods as , at the date of the Act , used to be sold to those two departments and sales of other goods even to those two departments , however necessary for the prosecution of the war , would not get benefit of the exemption . Such could not possibly be the intention of the Legislature as expressed by the language used by it in framing the Section . ”
