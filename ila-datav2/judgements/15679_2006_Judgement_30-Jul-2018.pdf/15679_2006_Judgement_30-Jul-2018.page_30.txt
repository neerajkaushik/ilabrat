30 Brief Making and the use of Law Books 343 ( Roger W. Cooley & Charles Lesly Ames eds . , 3d ed . 1914 ) . “ Strict interpretation is an equivocal expression , for it means either literal or narrow . When a provision is ambiguous , one of its meaning may be wider than the other , and the strict ( i.e. , narrow ) sense is not necessarily the strict ( i.e. , literal ) sense . ” John Salmond , Jurisprudence 171 n. ( t ) ( Glanville L. Williams ed . , 10 ™ ed . 1947 ) . 24.As contended by Ms. Pinky Anand , learned Additional Solicitor General , the principle of literal interpretation and the principle of strict interpretation are sometimes used interchangeably . This principle , however , may not be sustainable in all contexts and situations . There is certainly scope to sustain an argument that all cases of literal interpretation would involve strict rule of interpretation , but strict rule may not necessarily involve the former , especially in the area of taxation .
