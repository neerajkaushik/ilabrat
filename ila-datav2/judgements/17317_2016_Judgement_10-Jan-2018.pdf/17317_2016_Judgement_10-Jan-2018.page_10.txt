10 Court can take judicial notice of the fact that in any middle class household kitchenware / crockery / cutlery would value more than Rs.18,000/- . It is obvious that silver cutlery valuing Rs.31,000 / could not be insured under the head kitchenware / crockery / cutlery â€™ which was valued only for Rs.18,000/- . Therefore , the National Commission was right in holding that there was no coverage for this item . iii ) Clothing - The appellant claims that he has suffered a loss of Rs.87,000/- , as against the coverage of Rs.55,000/- . However , on perusing the statement of the appellant himself we find that he has shown Rs.87,000/- to be the value of only six items of clothing . There must have been many other items of clothing in the house and when all the clothing has been insured under one heading , it will include clothing items of all types , both expensive and in - expensive . Admittedly , all items of clothing were not stolen and , therefore , in this case the principle of under - insurance will have to apply and the National Commission was right in directing that the payment be made after applying principle of under - insurance .
