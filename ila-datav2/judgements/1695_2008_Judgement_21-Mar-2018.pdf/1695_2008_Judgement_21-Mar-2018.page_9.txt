three important witnesses i.e. PWs 1 , 2 and 3 , rightly disbelieved the presence of PWs 2 and 3 at the place of occurrence and discredited the evidence of P.W.1—complainant . Undoubtedly , the prosecution in its effort to establish the case with the support of evidences of PWs 1 , 2 and 3 , has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt . The High Court has , therefore , committed no illegality or manifest error in acquitting the accused giving them the benefit of doubt , under the circumstances . We express our concurrence with the findings recorded by the High Court for acquitting the respondents . For the aforesaid reasoning , we do not find any merit in this appeal calling for our interference under Article 136 of the Constitution . 15 . Accordingly , the Criminal Appeal filed by the appellant — State of U.P. is dismissed . eetessesceeaeessessesseeneease J. ( N.V. RAMANA ) suse eeu eneaNa ses sewessvesewss J.
