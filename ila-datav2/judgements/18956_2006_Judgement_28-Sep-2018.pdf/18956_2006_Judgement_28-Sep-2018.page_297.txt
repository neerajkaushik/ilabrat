PART J is in excess of the power conferred on the delegate is determined with reference to the specific provisions of the statute conferring the power and the object of the Act as gathered from its provisions . ' ° 90 Hindu women constitute a ‘ section or class ’ of Hindus under clauses b and c of Section 2 of the 1965 Act . The proviso to Section 4(1 ) forbids any regulation which discriminates against any Hindu on the ground of belonging to a particular section or class . Above all , the mandate of Section 3 is that if a place of public worship is open to Hindus generally or to any section or class of Hindus , it shall be open to all sections or classes of Hindus . The Sabarimala temple is open to Hindus generally and in any case to a section or class of Hindus . Hence it has to be open to all sections or classes of Hindus , including Hindu women . Rule 3(b ) gives precedence to customs and usages which allow the exclusion of women “ at such time during which they are not ... allowed to enter a place of public worship ” . In laying down such a prescription , Rule 3(b ) directly offends the right of temple entry established by Section 3 . Section 3 overrides any custom or usage to the contrary . But Rule 3 acknowledges , recognises and enforces a custom or usage to exclude women . This is plainly ultra vires . 123 Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Education v Paritosh Bhupeshkumar Sheth , ( 1984 ) 4 SCC . 27 126
