( ii ) ( iii ) ( iv ) 92 Lord Ayyappa are exclusively Hindus and do not constitute a separate religious denomination . Article 25(1 ) , by employing the expression ‘ all persons ’ , demonstrates that the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess , practise and propagate religion is available , though subject to the restrictions delineated in Article 25(1 ) itself , to every person including women . The right guaranteed under Article 25(1 ) has nothing to do with gender or , for that matter , certain physiological factors specifically attributable to women . The exclusionary practice being followed at the Sabrimala temple by virtue of Rule 3(b ) of the 1965 Rules violates the right of Hindu women to freely practise their religion and exhibit their devotion towards Lord Ayyappa . This denial denudes them of their right to worship . The right to practise religion under Article 25(1 ) is equally available to both men and women of all age groups professing the same religion . The impugned Rule 3(b ) of the 1965 Rules , framed under the 1965 Act , that stipulates exclusion of entiy of women of the age group of 10 to 50 years , is a clear violation of the right of Hindu women to practise their religious beliefs
