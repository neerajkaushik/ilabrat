The burden to prove that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa form a denomination within the meaning of Article 26 , as per the learned Amicus , is on the respondents , which they have failed to discharge as none of the three tests for determination of denominational status , i.e. , ( i ) common faith , ( ii ) common organization and ( iii ) designation by a distinctive name , have been established by the respondents .

It is also submitted by the learned Amicus that Devaswom Board in its counter affidavit before the Kerala High Court in S. Mahendran ( supra ) , had asserted , as is reflected vide para 7 of the judgment , that there was no such prohibition against women entering the temple and that there was no evidence to suggest any binding religious practice and , likewise , the High Court , in its judgment vide para 34 , found the exclusionary practice as just a usage and not a religious custom or essential religious practice .
