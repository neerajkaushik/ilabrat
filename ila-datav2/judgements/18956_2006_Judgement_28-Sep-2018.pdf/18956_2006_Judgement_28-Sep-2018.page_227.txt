PART F which untouchability has been abolished and its practice in any form forbidden . The Article further provides that the enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law . The Act , in this sense , is its logical corollary and must , therefore , be upheld . ” The decision in Saifuddin is presently pending consideration before a larger bench . 38 Durgah Committee and Saifuddin established the role of this Court in scrutinizing claims of practices essential to religion in order to deny constitutional protection to those practices that were not strictly based in religion . Ascertaining what was “ essential ” to a religious denomination “ according to its own tenets ” required a scrutiny of its religious texts . Durgah Committee laid down that the court would ‘ carefully scrutinize ’ claims to deny constitutional protection to those claims which are religious but spring from superstitious beliefs and are not essential to religion . Saifuddin laid down that a practice grounded on an obnoxious social rule or practice may be within the ambit of social reform that the State may carry out . This view infuses the doctrine with a safeguard against claims by religious denominations that any practice with a religious undertone would fall within the protection afforded by Article 26(b ) to them to ‘ manage its own affairs in matters of religion . ’ 56
