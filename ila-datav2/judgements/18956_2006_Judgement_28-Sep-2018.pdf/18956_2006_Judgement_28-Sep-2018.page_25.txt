25 worship and this includes women who , by custom or usage , are not allowed to enter a place of public worship . It has further been submitted by the applicant / intervenor that Rule 3(b ) is ultra vires the 1965 Act and is also unconstitutional for it violates Articles 14 , 15 , 17 , 21 and 25 of the Constitution in so far as it prohibits women from entering a public temple . The said Rule 3(b ) , as per the applicant / intervenor , is not an essential practice protected under Article 26 of the Constitution for it is not a part of religion as the devotees of Lord Ayyappa are just Hindus and they do not constitute a separate religious denomination under Article 26 of the Constitution as they do not have a common faith or a distinct name . To substantiate this view , the applicant / intervenor has drawn the attention of this Court to the judgment in S.P. Mittal ( supra ) . 36 . It has been submitted by the applicant / intervenor that even if we assume that Sabarimala is a religious denomination , the exclusion of women is not an essential practice as it does not satisfy the test of essential practice as has been laid down by this Court in Commissioner of Police and others v Acharya Jagadishwarananda Avadhuta and another' Â® .
