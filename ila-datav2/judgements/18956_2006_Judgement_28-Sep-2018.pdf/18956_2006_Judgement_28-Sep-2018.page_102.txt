“ As regards Article 26 , the first question is , what is the precise meaning or connotation of the expression “ religious denomination ” and whether a Math could come within this expression . The word “ denomination ” has been defined in the Oxford Dictionary to mean “ a collection of individuals classed together under the same name : a religious sect or body having a common faith and organisation and designated by a distinctive name ’ . It is well known that the practice of setting up Maths as centers of theological teaching was started by Shri Sankaracharya and was followed by various teachers since then . After Sankara , came a galaxy of religious teachers and philosophers who founded the different sects and sub - sects of the Hindu religion that we find in India at the present day . Each one of such sects or sub - sects _ can certainly be called_a religious denomination , as it is designated by_a distinctive name , — in many cases it is the name of the founder , and has a common faith and common _ spiritual organization . The followers of Ramanuja , who are known by the name of Shri Vaishnabas , undoubtedly constitute a _ religious denomination ; and so do _ the _ followers ’ of Madhwacharya and other religious teachers . It is a fact well established by tradition that the eight Udipi Maths were founded by Madhwacharya himself and the trustees and the beneficiaries of these Maths profess to be followers of that teacher . The High Court has found that the Math in question is in charge of the Sivalli Brahmins who constitute a section of the followers of Madhwacharya . As Article 26 contemplates not merely a _ religious denomination but also a section thereof , the Math or the spiritual fraternity represented by it can legitimately come within the purview of this article . ”    ( emphasis supplied ) ( at pp . 1021 - 1022 )
