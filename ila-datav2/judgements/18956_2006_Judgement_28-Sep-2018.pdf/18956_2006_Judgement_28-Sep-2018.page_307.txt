PART K excluding custom and usage from ‘ laws in force ’ under Article 13(1 ) read with Article 13(3)(b ) is unsustainable both doctrinally and from the perspective of the precedent of this Court . 96 Both Judges in Narasu relied on the phraseology of Section 112 of the Government of India Act 1915 which enjoined the High Courts in Calcutta , Madras , and Bombay to decide certain matters in the exercise of their original jurisdiction in accordance with the personal law or custom of the parties to the suit , and of the defendant , where the plaintiff and defendant are subject to different personal laws or custom : “ 112 . The High Courts at Calcutta , Madras and Bombay , in the exercise of their original jurisdiction in suits against inhabitants of Calcutta , Madras or Bombay , as the case may be , shall , in matters of inheritance and succession to lands , rents and goods , and in matters of contract and dealing between party and party , when both parties are subject to the same personal law or custom having the force of law , decide according to that personal law or custom , and when the parties are subject to different personal laws or custom having the force of law , decide according to the law or custom to which the defendant is subject . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) Relying on the disjunctive use of ‘ personal law ’ and ‘ custom having the force of law ’ ( separated by the use of the word ‘ or ’ ) , Chief Justice Chagla opined that despite the legislative precedent of the 1915 Act , the Constituent Assembly deliberately omitted a reference to ‘ personal law in Article 13 . Chief Justice Chagla held that this “ is a very clear pointer to the intention of the Constitution making body to exclude personal law from the purview of Article 13 . ” 136
