47 72 . After placing reliance on the decision of this Court in K.S. Puttaswamy ( supra ) , the Amicus has submitted that the exclusionary practice in its implementation results in involuntary disclosure by women of both their menstrual status and age which amounts to forced disclosure that consequently violates the right to dignity and privacy embedded in Article 21 of the Constitution of India . 73 . It has also been submitted by the Amicus Curiae that Article 25(2)(b ) is not a mere enabling provision but is a substantive right as it creates an exception for laws providing for social reform or throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus and thereby embodies the constitutional intent of abhorring exclusionary practices . Further , referring to the judgment of this Court in Devaru ( supra ) , the learned Amicus has submitted that Article 25(2)(b ) does not merely seek to prevent exclusionary practices on the basis of caste only , for the rights under Part III of the Constitution must be given a broad meaning and any exception must be given a narrow construction . 74 . Further , it has been submitted by the learned Amicus that the exclusionary practice in the present case can not be justified
