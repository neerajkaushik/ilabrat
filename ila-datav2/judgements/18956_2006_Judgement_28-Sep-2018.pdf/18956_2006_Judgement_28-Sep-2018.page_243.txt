PART G first rice - feeding ceremony of their children.*9 The Secretary of the Ayyappa Seva Sangham had deposed that young women were seen in Sabarimala during the previous ten to fifteen years . ° ° A former Devaswom Commissioner admitted that the first rice - feeding ceremony of her grandchild was conducted at the Sabarimala Temple . The High Court found that during the twenty years preceding the decision , women irrespective of age were allowed to visit the temple when it opened for monthly poojas , ° ' but were prohibited from entering the temple only during Mandalam , Makaravilakku and Vishu seasons . * ? The High Court thus noted multiple instances wherein women were allowed to pray at the Sabarimala temple . These observations demonstrate that the practice of excluding women from the Sabarimala temple was not uniform . This militates against a claim that such a practice is of an obligatory nature . That such practice has not been followed on numerous occasions , also shows that the denial of constitutional protection to an exclusionary practice will not result in a fundamental change in the character of the religion as required by Avadhuta Il . 52 The High Court proceeded on the basis of the ‘ complete autonomy ’ of the followers in determining the essentiality of the practice ® * . This followed the dictum in Shirur Mutt , without taking note of evolution of precedent thereafter , 49 Ibid 50 Ibid , at para 32 51 Ibid , at paras 8 , 10 52 Ibid , at para 43 53 |bid , at para 22 72
