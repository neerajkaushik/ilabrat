PART J The proviso to Section 3 creates an exception by providing that if the place of public worship is a temple which is founded for the benefit of any religious denomination or section thereof , Section 3 would be subject to the right of that religious denomination or section to manage its own affairs in matters of religion . The proviso recognises the entitlement of a religious denomination to manage its own affairs in matters of religion . However , the proviso is attracted only if the following conditions are satisfied : ( i ) The place of public worship is a temple ; and ( ii ) The temple has been founded for the benefit of any religious denomination or section thereof . 87 We have held that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa do not constitute a religious denomination and the Sabarimala temple is not a denominational temple . The proviso has no application . The notifications which restrict the entry of women between the ages of ten and fifty in the Sabarimala temple can not stand scrutiny and plainly infringe Section 3 . They prevent any woman between the age of ten and fifty from entering the Sabarimala temple and from offering prayers . Such a restriction would infringe the rights of all Hindu women which are recognized by Section 3 . The notifications issued by the Board prohibiting the entry of women between ages ten and fifty - five , are ultra vires Section 3 . 123
