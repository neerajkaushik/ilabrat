PART F Before parting with the judgment , Justice Gajendragadkar issued an important “ note of caution ” : “ 33 ... in order that the practices in question should be treated as a part of religion they must be regarded by the said religion as its essential and integral part ; otherwise even purely secular practices which are not an essential or an integral part of religion are apt to be clothed with a religious form and may make aclaim for being treated as religious practices within the meaning of Article 26 . Similarly , even practices though religious may have sprung from merely superstitious beliefs and may in that sense be extraneous and unessential accretions to religion itself . Unless such practices are found to constitute an essential and integral part of a religion their claim for the protection under Article 26 may have to be carefully scrutinised ; in other words , the protection must be confined to such religious practices as are an essential and an integral part of it and no other . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 35 This statement pushed the essential religious practices doctrine in a new direction . The Court distinguished , for the first time , between ‘ superstitious beliefs ’ and religious practice . Apart from engaging in a judicial enquiry to determine whether a practice claimed to be essential was in fact grounded in religious scriptures , beliefs , and tenets , the Court would ‘ carefully scrutinize ’ that the practice claiming constitutional protection does not claim superstition as its base . This was considered a necessary safeguard to ensure that superstitious beliefs would not be afforded constitutional protection in the garb of an essential religious practice . The Court also emphasized that purely secular matters clothed with a religious form do not enjoy protection as an essential part of religion . 53
