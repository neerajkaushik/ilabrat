In the present writ petition filed before this Court , an affidavit filed by a Thanthri of the Sabarimala temple dated 23.04.2016 makes interesting reading . According to the affidavit , two Brahmin brothers from Andhra Pradesh were tested by Sage Parasuram and were named “ Tharanam ” and “ Thazhamon ” . The present Thanthri is a descendant of the Thazhamon brother , who is authorized to perform rituals in Sastha temples . The affidavit then refers to the Sabarimala Temple , which is dedicated to Lord Ayyappa , as a prominent temple in Kerala which is visited by over twenty million pilgrims and devotees every year . The temple is only open during the first five days of every Malayalam month , and during the festivals of Mandalam , Makaravilakku , and Vishu . Significantly , no daily poojas are performed in the said temple . It is stated in the affidavit that Lord Ayyappa had himself explained that the pilgrimage to Sabarimala can be undertaken 60
