PART H The judgement cited the ruling of Lord Halsbury in Free Church of Scotland v Overtoun ” : “ In the absence of conformity to essentials , the denomination would not be an entity cemented into solidity by harmonious uniformity of opinion , it would be a mere incongruous heap of , as it were , grains of sand , thrown together without being united , each of these intellectual and isolated grains differing from every other , and the whole forming a but nominally united while really unconnected mass ; fraught with nothing but internal dissimilitude , and mutual and reciprocal contradiction and dissension . ” 69 Adherence to a ‘ common faith ’ would entail that a common set of beliefs have been followed since the conception of the particular sect or denomination . A distinctive feature of the pilgrimage is that pilgrims of all religions participate in the pilgrimage on an equal footing . Muslims and Christians undertake the pilgrimage . A member of any religion can be a part of the collective of individuals who worship Lord Ayyappa . Religion is not the basis of the collective of individuals who worship the deity . Bereft of a religious identity , the collective can not claim to be regarded as a ‘ religious denomination ’ . To be within the fold of Article 26 , a denomination must be a religious sect or body . Worship of the presiding deity is not confined to adherents of a particular religion . Coupled with this is the absence of a common spiritual organisation , which is a necessary element to constitute a religious denomination . The temple at which worship is carried out is dedicated to the public and represents truly , the plural character of society . Everyone , irrespective of religious belief , can worship the deity .
