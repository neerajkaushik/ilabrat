59 “ The only condition for membership is that the person seeking the membership of the Society must subscribe to the aims and objects of the Society . It was further urged that what is universal can not be a religious denomination . In order to constitute a separate denomination , there must be something distinct from another . A denomination , argues the counsel , is one which is different from the other and if the Society was a religious denomination , then the person seeking admission to the institution would lose his previous religion . He can not be a member of two religions at one and the same time . But this is not the position in becoming a member of the Society and Auroville . A _ religious denomination must necessarily be a new one and new methodology must be provided for a religion . Substantially , the view taken by Sri Aurobindo remains a part of the Hindu philosophy . There may be certain innovations in his philosophy but that would not make it a religion on that account . ” 92 . The Court in S.P Mittal ( supra ) reiterated and concurred with the definition of ‘ religious denomination ’ which was also accepted in Shirur Mutt ( supra ) and observed as under : " The words ‘ religious denomination ' in Article 26 of the Constitution must take their colour from the word ' religion ' and if this be so , the expression ‘ religious denomination ' must also satisfy three conditions : ( 1 ) It must be a collection of individuals who have a system of beliefs or doctrines which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well - being , that is , a common faith ; ( 2 ) common organisation , and ( 3 ) designation by a distinctive name .
