bestowed with the Herculean task to act as levellers in this regard and for the same , one has to remember the wise saying of Henry Ward Beecher that deals with the changing perceptions of the world in time . He says : “ Our days are a kaleidoscope . Every instant a change takes place in the contents . New harmonies , new contrasts , new combinations of every sort . Nothing ever happens twice alike . The most familiar people stand each moment in some new relation to each other , to their work , to surrounding objects . The most tranquil house , with the most serene inhabitants , living upon the utmost regularity of system , is yet exemplifying infinite diversities . ” ! 3 . Any relationship with the Creator is a transcendental one crossing all socially created artificial barriers and not a negotiated relationship bound by terms and conditions . Such a relationship and expression of devotion can not be circumscribed by dogmatic notions of biological or physiological factors arising out of rigid socio - cultural attitudes which do not meet the constitutionally prescribed tests . Patriarchy in religion can not be permitted to trump over the element of pure devotion borne out of faith and the freedom to practise and profess one ’s religion . The subversion and repression of women under the garb of biological or physiological factors can not be given the seal of " Henry Ward Beecher , 1813 - 1887 - Eyes and Ears
