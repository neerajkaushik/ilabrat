religion are subject to and can be controlled by a law contemplated under Article 25(2)(b ) as both the Articles are required to be read harmoniously . It is also well established that social reforms or the need for regulations contemplated by Article 25(2 ) can not obliterate essential religious practices or their performances and what would constitute the essential part of a religion can be ascertained with reference to the doctrine of that religion itself . In support of the aforesaid established propositions , the respondents have referred to and relied upon the judgment in Commr . , Hindu Religious Endowments v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt [ AIR 1954 SC 282 : 1954 SCR 1005 ] and also upon Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. State of Mysore [ AIR 1958 SC 255 : 1958 SCR 895 ] . ” The observation that regulations contemplated by Article 25 can not obliterate essential religious practices is understandable as regulations are not restrictions . However , social reform legislation , as has been seen above , may go to the extent of trumping religious practice , if so found on the facts of a given case . Equally , the task of carrying out reform affecting religious belief is left by Article 25(2 ) in the hands of the State ( See paragraph 66 ) . 20 .
