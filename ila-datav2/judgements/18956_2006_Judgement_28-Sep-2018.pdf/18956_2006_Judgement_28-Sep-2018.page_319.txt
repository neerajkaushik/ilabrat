It is difficult and rather impossible to define or delimit the expressions ‘ religion ’ or “ matters of religion ” used in Articles 25 and 26 . Essentially , religion is a matter of personal faith and belief of personal relations of an individual with what he regards as Cosmos , his Maker or his Creator which , he believes , regulates the existence of insentient beings and the forces of the universe . ”155 ( Emphasis supplied ) 106 A religious denomination or any section thereof has a right under Article 26 to manage religious affairs .
