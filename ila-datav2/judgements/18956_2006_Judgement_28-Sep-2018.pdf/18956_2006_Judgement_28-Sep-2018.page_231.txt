PART F 41 . In Acharya Jagdishwaranand Avadhuta v. Commissioner of Police , Calcutta ® ® ( “ Avadhuta | ” ) , a three judge Bench of this Court considered whether the police could prevent the Ananda Margis from performing the ‘ tandava dance ’ in public , in which adherents dance in a public procession carrying knives , live snakes , tridents , and skulls . The Court enquired ‘ whether performance of Tandava dance is a religious rite or practice essential to the tenets of the religious faith of the Ananda Margis . ’ Justice Ranganath Misra , writing for the Court , held that since the Ananda Margis were a recent religious order , and the tandava dance an even more recent innovation , it could not be considered an essential religious practice : “ 14.Ananda Marga as a religious order is of recent origin and tandava dance as a part of religious rites of that order is still more recent . It is doubtful as to whether in such circumstances tandava dance can be taken as an essential religious rite of the Ananda Margis . “ Even conceding that Tandava dance has been prescribed as a religious rite for every follower of Ananda Margis it does not follow as a necessary corollary that Tandava dance to be performed in the public is a matter of religious rite . In fact , there is no justification in any of the writings of Shri Ananda Murti that tandava dance must be performed in public . ”54 42 In Sri Adi Visheshwara of Kashi Vishwanath Temple , Varanasi v State of Uttar Pradesh ® ( “ Adi Visheshwara ’ ) , a three judge Bench of this Court dealt with a challenge to the Uttar Pradesh Sri Kashi Vishwanath Temple Act , 1983 , which entrusted the State with the management of the temple as 33 ( 1983 ) 4 SCC 522 54 Ibid , at pages 532 - 533 35 ( 1997 ) 4 SCC 606 60
