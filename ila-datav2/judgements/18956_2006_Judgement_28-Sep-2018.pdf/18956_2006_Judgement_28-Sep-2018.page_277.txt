PART | hierarchical order of purity and pollution enforced by social compulsion . Purity and pollution constitute the core of caste . While the top of the caste pyramid is considered pure and enjoys entitlements , the bottom is considered polluted and has no entitlements . Ideas of “ purity and pollution ” are used to justify this distinction which is self - perpetuality . The upper castes perform rituals that , they believe , assert and maintain their purity over lower castes . Rules of purity and pollution are used to reinforce caste hierarchies . The notion of “ purity and pollution ” influences who people associate with , and how they treat and are treated by other people . Dr Ambedkar ’s rejection of privileges associated with caste , in “ Annihilation of Caste ” ® ’ , is hence a battle for human dignity . Dr Ambedkar perceived the caste system to be violative of individual dignity.% In his last address to the Constituent Assembly , he stated that the caste system is contrary to the country ’s unity and integrity , and described it as bringing “ separation in social life”. ° 9 Individual dignity can not be based on the notions of purity and pollution . “ Untouchability ” against lower castes was based on these notions , and violated their dignity . It is for this reason that Article 17 abolishes “ untouchability ” , which arises out of caste hierarchies . Article 17 strikes at the foundation of the notions about “ purity and pollution ” . 96 Diane Coffey and Dean Spears , Where India Goes : Abandoned Toilets , Stunted Development and the Costs of Caste , Harper Collins ( 2017 ) , at pages 74 - 79 87 See Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar : Writings and Speeches , ( Vasant Moon ed . ) Government of Maharashtra , Vol . 1 ( 2014 ) , at pages 23 - 96 98 See Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar : Writings and Speeches , ( Vasant Moon ed . ) Government of Maharashtra , Vol . 12 ( 2014 ) , at pages 661 - 691 . 9 Constituent Assembly Debates ( 25 November 1949 ) 106
