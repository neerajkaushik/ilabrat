Constitution , and not of Courts as the arbiter of constitutional rights and principles . 21 . A conspectus of these judgments , therefore , leads to the following propositions : 21.1 . Article 25 recognises a fundamental right in favour of “ all persons ” which has reference to natural persons . 21.2 . This fundamental right equally entitles all such persons to the said fundamental right . Every member of a religious community has a right to practice the religion so long as he does not , in any way , interfere with the corresponding right of his co - religionists to do the same . 21.3 . The content of the fundamental right is the fleshing out of what is stated in the Preamble to the Constitution as “ liberty of thought , belief , faith and worship ” . Thus , all persons are entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess , practice , and propagate religion . 21.4 . The right to profess , practice , and propagate religion will include all acts done in furtherance of thought , belief , faith , and worship . 51
