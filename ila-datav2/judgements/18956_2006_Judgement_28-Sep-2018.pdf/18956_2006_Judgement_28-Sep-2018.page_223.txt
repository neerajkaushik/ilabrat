PART F The Court looked to the texts and scriptures of the religious community to conclude that the practice claimed to be essential was not supported by religious tenets . 34 In Durgah Committee , Ajmer v Syed Hussain Ali ? ® ( “ Durgah Committee ” ) , a Constitution Bench of this Court considered a challenge to the Durgah Khawaja Saheb Act , 1955 , which provided for the constitution of a Committee to manage a Muslim Durgah . The Respondents , who were khadims ” of the Durgah , contended that the Act barred them from managing the Durgah and receiving offerings from pilgrims , and hence infringed upon their rights under Article 26 as Muslims belonging to the Soofi Chishtia Order . Rather than making a reference to scriptures , Justice Gajendragadkar , writing for the Court , considered the history of the Ajmer shrine to determine that the right to administer the property never vested in the Respondents : “ 22 . Thus it would be clear that from the middle of the 16th Century to the middle of the 20th Century the administration and management of the Durgah Endowment has been true to the same pattern . The said administration has been treated as a matter with which the State is concerned and it has been left in charge of the Mutawallis who were appointed from time to time by the State and even removed when they were found to be guilty of misconduct or when it was felt that their work was unsatisfactory . ” ° 8 ( 1962 ) 1 SCR 383 8 According to the khadims , they were descendants of two followers of the twelfth century Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti , whose tomb at Ajmer is known as the Durgah Khwaja Saheb . The khadims also claimed they belonged to a religious denomination known as the Chishtia Sufis . 52
