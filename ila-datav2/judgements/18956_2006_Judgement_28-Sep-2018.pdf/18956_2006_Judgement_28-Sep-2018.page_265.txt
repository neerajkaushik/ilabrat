PART | untouchability . Shiva Rao has recounted that the Committee came to the general conclusion that “ the purpose of the clause was to abolish untouchability in all its forms — whether it was untouchability within a community or between various communities ’ ’ ” ’ . In the proceedings , K M Panikkar elaborated the point by observing that the clause intended to abolish various disabilities arising out of untouchability , irrespective of religion . ” ® He remarked : “ If somebody says that he is not going to touch me , that is not a civil right which | can enforce in a court of law . There are certain complex of disabilities that arise from the practice of untouchability in India . Those disabilities are in the nature of civil obligations or civil disabilities and what we have attempted to provide for is that these disabilities that exist in regard to the individual , whether he be a Christian , Muslim or anybody else , if he suffers from these disabilities , they should be eradicated through the process of law . ” ” ° Rajagopalachari suggested a minor amendment of the clause , which sought to make “ the imposition of any disability of any kind or any such custom of ‘ untouchability ” an offence . Taking note of the suggestions and views expressed , the clause was redrafted as clause 6 in the Interim Report of the Advisory Committee as follows : “ Untouchability ” in any form is abolished and the imposition of any disability on that account shall be an offence . ” 77 B Shiva Rao , The Framing of India ’s Constitution : A Study , Indian Institution of Public Administration ( 1968 ) , at page 202 78 B Shiva Rao has remarked that Panikkar ’s reference was to the depressed classes who had been converted to Christianity in Travancore - Cochin and Malabar .
