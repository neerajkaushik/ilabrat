particular_religion or as to the propriety of any particular religious observance . The_obiter of Gajendragadkar J. in the Durgah Committee _ case_is_also__inconsistent__with__the observations of Mukherjea J. in Ratilal Gandhi Case , that the decision in Jamshedji v. Soonabai afforded_an indication of the measure of protection given by Article 26(b ) . ” ° ? ( Emphasis supplied )      Mr. Seervai also criticised the observations of this Court in Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj etc . v. State of Rajasthan & Ors . ( supra ) as follows : “ 12.66 In Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji v. Rajasthan Gajendragadkar J. again adverted to the rights under Arts . 25(1 ) and 26(b ) and stated that if a matter was obviously secular and not religious , a Court would be justified in rejecting its claim to be a religious practise , as based on irrational considerations . It is submitted that the real question is whether the religious denomination looks upon it as an essential part of its religion , and_however irrational it may appear to persons who_do_not_share_that_religious_belief , the view of the denomination must prevail , for , it is not open to a court to describe as irrational that which is a part of a denomination ’s religion . The actual decision in the case , that the right to manage the property was a secular matter , is correct , but that is because , as pointed out by Mukherjea J. , Art . 26(b ) when constrasted with Art . 26(c ) and ( d ) shows that matters of religious belief and practises are distinct and separate from the management of property of a religious denomination . The distinction between religious belief and practises which can not be controlled , and the management of the property of a religious denomination which _ can_be controlled_to a limited extent , is recognised by the Article itself and _ must be enforced . But this distinction is not relevant to the question whether a religious practise is itself irrational or secular . ”>% ( Emphasis supplied ) J. Duncan M.
