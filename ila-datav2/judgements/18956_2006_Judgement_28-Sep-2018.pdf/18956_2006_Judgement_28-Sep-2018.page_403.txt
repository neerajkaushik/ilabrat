14 . ARTICLE 17 14.1 . 14.2 . 14.3 . The contention of the Petitioners that the restriction imposed on the entry of women during the notified age group , tantamounts to a form of ‘ Untouchability ’ under Article 17 of the Constitution , is liable to be rejected for the reasons stated hereinafter . All forms of exclusion would not tantamount to untouchability . Article 17 pertains to untouchability based on caste prejudice . Literally or historically , untouchability was never understood to apply to women as a class . The right asserted by the Petitioners is different from the right asserted by Dalits in the temple entry movement . The restriction on women within a certain age - band , is based upon the historical origin and the beliefs and practises of the Sabarimala Temple . In the present case , women of the notified age group are allowed entry into all other temples of Lord Ayyappa . The restriction on the entry of women during the notified age group in this Temple is based on the unique characteristic of the deity , and not founded on any social exclusion . The analogy sought to be drawn by comparing the rights of Dalits with reference to entry to temples and women is wholly misconceived and unsustainable . The right asserted by Dalits was in pursuance of right against systematic social exclusion and for social acceptance per se . In the case of temple entry , social reform preceded the statutory reform , and not the other way about . The social reform was spearheaded by great religious as well as national leaders like Swami 67
