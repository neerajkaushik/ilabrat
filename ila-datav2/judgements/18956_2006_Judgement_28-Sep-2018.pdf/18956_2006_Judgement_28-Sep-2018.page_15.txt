15 “ The contention formulated in such broad terms can not , we think , be supported . In the first place , what constitutes the essential part of a religion is primarily to be ascertained with reference to the doctrines of that religion itself . If the tenets of any religious sect of the Hindus prescribe that offerings of food should be given to the idol at particular hours of the day , that periodical ceremonies should be performed in a certain way at certain periods of the year or that there should be daily recital of sacred texts or ablations to the sacred fire , all these would be regarded as parts of religion and the mere fact that they involve expenditure of money or employment of priests and servants or the use of marketable commodities would not make them secular activities partaking of a commercial or economic character ; all of them are religious practices and should be regarded as matters of religion within the meaning of article 26(b ) . ” 20 . As per the petitioners , this Court in Shirur Mutt ( supra ) , while giving freedom under clauses ( a ) and ( b ) of Article 26 , made it clear that what is protected is only the ‘ essential part ’ of religion or , in other words , the essence of ‘ practice ’ practised by a religious denomination and , therefore , the petitioners submit that before any religious practice is examined on the touchstone of constitutional principles , it has to be ascertained positively whether the said practice is , in pith and substance , really the ‘ essence ’ of the said religion .
