PART F becomes ultimately an exercise of judicial balancing . Durgah Committee established that in examining a claim that a practice is essential to religion , the Court must ‘ carefully scrutinize ’ the claims put before it in order to ensure that practices which have sprung from ‘ superstitious beliefs ’ , through grounded in religion , will not be afforded constitutional protection . Saifuddin recognized that where a purportedly essential practice is based on an ‘ obnoxious social rule or practice ’ , it would be amenable to a measure of social reform . Of crucial importance are the observations in Devaru , where the Court harmonized the inherent tension between the individual right under Article 25(2)(b ) and the denominational right under Article 26(b ) . Where the protection of denominational rights would substantially reduce the right conferred by Article 25(2)(b ) , the latter would prevail against the former . This ensures that the constitutional guarantee under Article 25(2)(b ) is not destroyed by exclusionary claims which detract from individual dignity . That a practice claimed to be essential has been carried on since time immemorial or is grounded in religious texts , does not lend to it constitutional protection unless it passes the test of essentiality . 68
