PART | though the attention of the framers was drawn to the fact that “ untouchability ” is not a practice referable only to the lowest in the caste ordering but also was practiced against women ( and in the absence of a definition , the prohibition would cover all its forms ) , the expression was designedly left undefined . The Constitution uses the expression “ untouchability ” in inverted comas . The use of a punctuation mark can not be construed as intent to circumscribe the constitutional width of the expression . The historical backdrop to the inclusion of the provision was provided by centuries of subjugation , discrimination and social exclusion . Article 17 is an intrinsic part of the social transformation which the Constitution seeks to achieve . Hence in construing it , the language of the Constitution should not be ascribed a curtailed meaning which will obliterate its true purpose . “ Untouchability ” in any form is forbidden . The operation of the words used by the Constitution can not be confined to a particular form or manifestation of “ untouchability ” . The Constitution as a constantly evolving instrument has to be flexible to reach out to injustice based on untouchability , in any of its forms or manifestations . Article 17 is a powerful guarantee against exclusion . As an expression of the anti - exclusion principle , it can not be read to exclude women against whom social exclusion of the worst kind has been practiced and legitimized on notions of purity and pollution . 80 _ The provisions of Article 17 have been adverted to in judicial decisions .
