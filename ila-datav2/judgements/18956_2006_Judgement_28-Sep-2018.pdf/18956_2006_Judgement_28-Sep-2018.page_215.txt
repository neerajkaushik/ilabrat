PART F F Essential Religious Practices 29 ~The doctrine of essential religious practices was first articulated in 1954 , in Commissioner , Hindu Religious Endowments , Madras v _ Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Shirur Mutt ? ( “ Shirur Mutt ” ) . A seven judge Bench of this Court considered a challenge to the Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act 1951 , which empowered a statutory commissioner to frame and settle a scheme if they had reason to believe that the religious institution was mismanaging funds . The Petitioner , the mathadhipati ( Superior ) of the Shirur Mutt monastery , claimed that the law interfered with his right to manage the religious affairs of the monastery , and therefore violated Article 26(b ) of the Constitution . Justice B K Mukherjea , writing for the Court , noted that Article 26(b ) allowed a religious denomination to ‘ manage its own affairs in matters of religion ’ and framed a question on the ambit of ‘ matters of religion ’ : “ 16.The language undoubtedly suggests that there could be other affairs of a religious denomination or a section thereof which are not matters of religion and to which the guarantee given by this clause would not apply . The question is , where is the line to be drawn between what are matters of religion and what are not ? ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 23 1954 SCR 1005 44
