( xv ) This judgment being a declaration of the status of this temple as a religious denomination , is a judgment in rem . The said judgment has not been challenged by any party . Hence , it would be binding on all parties , including the Petitioners herein . The following observation from the judgment of this Court in Dr. Subramanian Swamy v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors . ( supra ) was relied upon : “ The declaration that Dikshitars are religious denomination or section thereof is in fact a declaration of their status and making such declaration is in fact a judgment in rem . ” ( Internal quotations omitted ) Unlike Article 25 , which is subject to the other provisions of Pat III of the Constitution , Article 26 is subject only to public order , morality , and health , and not to the other provisions of the Constitution . As a result , the Fundamental Rights of the denomination is not subject to Articles 14 or 15 of the Constitution . With respect to Article 25(1 ) , it was submitted that the worshippers of Lord Ayyappa are entitled to the freedom of conscience , and the right to profess , practise and propagate their religion . The right to profess their faith by worshipping at the Sabarimala Temple , can be guaranteed only if the character of the deity as a ‘ Naishtik Brahmachar ? is preserved . If women between the age of 10 to 50 years are permitted entry , it would result in changing the very character / nature of the deity , which would directly impinge on the right of the devotees to practise their religion guaranteed by Article 25(1 ) of the Constitution . 20
