PART F that the practice must be of such a nature that its absence would result in a fundamental change in the character of that religion : “ 9.Essential part of a religion means the core beliefs upon which a religion is founded . Essential practice means those practices that are fundamental to follow a religious belief . It is upon the cornerstone of essential parts or practices that the superstructure of a religion is built , without which a religion will be no religion . Test to determine whether a part or practice is essential to a religion is to find out whether the nature of the religion will be changed without that part or practice . If the taking away of that part or practice could result ina fundamental change in the character of that religion or in its belief , then such part could be treated as an essential or integral part . There can not be additions or subtractions to such part because it is the very essence of that religion and alterations will change its fundamental character . It is such permanent essential parts which are protected by the Constitution ... Such alterable parts or practices are definitely not the ' core ' of religion where the belief is based and religion is founded upon . It could only be treated as mere embellishments to the non - essential part or practices . ”4 ° ( Emphasis supplied ) The essentiality test came to be linked to the “ fundamental character ” of the religion . If the abrogation of a practice does not change the fundamental nature of the religion , the practice itself is not essential . Rejecting the claim of the Anand Margis , the majority held that the Ananda Margi order was in existence ( 1955 - 66 ) even without the practice of the Tandava dance . Hence , such a practice would not constitute the ‘ core ’ of the religion . 40 Ibid , at pages 782 - 783 63
