( i ) ( iii ) ( iv ) ( v ) Board dated October 21 , 1955 and November 27 , 1956 , does not meet the tests of Articles 14 , 15 and 21 of the Constitution . This exclusionary practise violates Article 14 as the classification lacks a Constitutional object . It is manifestly arbitrary as it is based on physiological factors alone , and does not serve any valid object . The customary practise violates Article 15(1 ) of the Constitution as it is based on ‘ sex ’ alone . The practise also violates Article 15(2)(b ) since the Sabarimala Temple is a public place of worship being open and dedicated to the public and is partly funded by the State under Article 290A. Article 25 guarantees the Fundamental Right to an individual to worship or follow any religion . The 1965 Act has been passed in furtherance of the goals enshrined in Article 25(2)(b ) as a ‘ measure of social reform ’ . The Act contains no prohibition against women from entering any public temple . Rule 3(b ) of the 1965 Rules is ultra vires the Act insofar as it prohibits the entry of women . The Petitioners contend that a religious denomination must have the following attributes : e It has its own property & establishment capable of succession by its followers . e It has its distinct identity clearly distinguishable from any established religion .
