PART | scope . A reconstruction of the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly suggests that the members agreed to the Constitutional Advisor ’s insistence that the law which is to be enacted for implementing the provision on “ untouchability ” would provide a definition of the term . The rejection of Naziruddin Anmad ’s amendment by the members of the Constituent Assembly reflects a conscious effort not to limit the scope of the legislation to be enacted . 73 In order to fully understand the constitutional philosophy underlying the insertion of Article 17 , this Court must also deal with one specific instance during the proceedings of the Constituent Assembly . As mentioned above , while Professor KT Shah gave specific examples of acts of “ untouchability ” , including that of women being considered untouchables “ in certain periods ” , and argued for a specific definition , Dr Ambedkar furnished no reply . This raises the question as to why Dr Ambedkar did not accept Naziruddin Ahmad ’s amendment and refused to reply to KT Shah ’s remarks . One member of the Constituent Assembly , Monomohan Das , remarked during the debate on the draft Article on “ untouchability ” : “ " .. It is an irony of fate that the man who was driven from one school to another , who was forced to take his lessons outside the class room , has been entrusted with this great job of framing the Constitution of free and independent India , and it is he who has finally dealt the death blow to this custom of untouchability , of which he was himself a victim in his younger days . ”8 ” 87 Constituent Assembly Debates ( 29 November 1948 ) 99
