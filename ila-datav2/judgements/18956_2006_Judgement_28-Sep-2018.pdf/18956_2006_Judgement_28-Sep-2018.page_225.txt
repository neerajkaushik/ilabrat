PART F 36 ‘ The test was narrowed down further in Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb v State of Bombay ( “ Saifuddin ’ ” ) , * ° where this Court , by a 4 - 1 majority , struck down the Bombay Prevention of Excommunication Act , 1949 , which prohibited the practice of excommunication within religious communities . The Court held that the practice of excommunication within the Dawoodi Bohra faith on religious grounds fell within ‘ matters of religion ’ under Article 26(b ) and was thus constitutionally protected . Justice Das Gupta , writing for the majority , emphasized that the practice claimed to be essential must be based strictly on religious grounds in order to claim constitutional protection : “ 43 ... The barring of excommunication on grounds other than religious grounds say , on the breach of some obnoxious social rule or practice might be a measure of social reform and alaw which bars such excommunication merely might conceivably come within the saving provisions of clause 2(b ) of Art . 25 . But barring of excommunication on religious grounds pure and simple , can not however be considered to promote social welfare and reform and consequently the law in so far as it invalidates excommunication on religious grounds and takes away the Dai 's power to impose such excommunication can not reasonably be considered to be a measure of social welfare and reform . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) The Court , therefore , enquired into the basis of excommunication : if its basis was strictly religious , the practice would warrant constitutional protection . If , however , the practice was based on any other ground , it would be open to the Legislature to prohibit such a practice . 50 1962 Supp ( 2 ) SCR 496 54
