PART F The Court ruled that the freedom of religion guaranteed by the Constitution applied to freedom of both religious belief and practice . To distinguish between the religious and the secular , the Court looked to the religion itself , and noted that the views of adherents were crucial to the analysis of what constituted ‘ essential ’ aspects of religion . 30   ~=This approach was followed in Ratilal Panachand Gandhi v State of Bombay ” ( ‘ “ Ratilal ” ) , where a Constitution Bench of this Court considered the constitutionality of the Bombay Public Trusts Act , 1950 . The Act sought to regulate and make provisions for the administration of public and religious trusts in the State of Bombay . The Petitioners challenged the validity of the Act on the grounds that it interfered with their freedom of conscience , their right to freely profess , practise and propagate their religion , and their right to manage their religious affairs under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution . Justice B K Mukherjea , speaking for a Constitution Bench of this Court , expounded upon the meaning and scope of Article 25 : “ 10 ... Subject to the restrictions which this article imposes , every person has a fundamental right under our Constitution not merely to entertain such religious belief as may be approved of by his judgment or conscience but to exhibit his belief and ideas in such overt acts as are enjoined or sanctioned by his religion and further to propagate his religious views for the edification of others . ” 25 1954 SCR 1055 46
