The issues raised in the present Writ Petition have far - reaching ramifications and implications , not only for the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala , but for all places of worship of various religions in this country , which have their own beliefs , practises , customs and usages , which may be considered to be exclusionary in nature . In a secular polity , issues which are matters of deep religious faith and sentiment , must not ordinarily be interfered with by Courts . In the past , the Courts , in the context of Hindu temples , have been asked to identify the limits of State action under Articles 25 and 26 on the administration , control and management of the affairs of temples , including the appointment of archakas . For instance , in the case of Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal Nala Sangam & Ors . v. Government of Tamil Nadu & Anr.1 Â© , this Court was asked to consider the issue of appointment of archakas in Writ Petitions filed by an association of archakas and individual archakas of Sri Meenakshi Amman Temple of Madurai . The present case is a PIL filed by an association of lawyers , who have invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court to review certain practises being followed by the Sabarimala Temple on the grounds of 16 ( 2016 ) 2 SCC 725 22
