PART F 32 ‘ This case marked a nuance of the essential practices doctrine laid down in Shirur Mutt , where a denomination was granted ‘ complete autonomy ’ to determine which practices it considered to be essential . In Shirur Mutt , the autonomy to decide what is essential to religion was coupled with the definition of religion itself , which was to comprehend belief and practice . In Devaru , the Court laid down a crucial precedent in carving out its role in examining the essentiality of such practices . While the Court would take into consideration the views of a religious community in determining whether a practice qualified as essential , this would not be determinative . Prior to Devaru , this Court used the word ‘ essential ’ to distinguish between religious and secular practices in order to circumscribe the extent of state intervention in religious matters . The shift in judicial approach took place when ‘ essentially religious ’ ( as distinct from the secular ) became conflated with ‘ essential to religion . ’ The Court ’s enquiry into the essentiality of the practice in question represented a shift in the test , which now enjoined upon the Court the duty to decide which religious practices would be afforded constitutional protection , based on the determination of what constitutes an essential religious practice . 33 In Mohd .
