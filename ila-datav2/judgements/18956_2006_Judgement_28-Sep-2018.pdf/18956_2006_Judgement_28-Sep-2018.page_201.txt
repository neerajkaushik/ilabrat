PART C The penance is to be carried out in the manner prescribed . Maintaining oneself as ‘ pure and unpolluted ’ , it is believed , would lead to the path towards attaining Godhead or to be one with Lord Ayyappa . C Temple entry and the exclusion of women Before proceeding to analyse the questions in this reference , it would be necessary to outline the history of the case bearing upon the controversy . 26 Two notifications were issued by the Travancore Devaswom Board which read as follows : Notification dated 21 October 1955 “ In accordance with the fundamental principle underlying the prathishta ( installation ) of the venerable , holy and ancient temple of Sabarimala , Ayyappans who had not observed the usual vows as well as women who had attained maturity were not in the habit of entering the above mentioned temple for Darshan ( worship ) by stepping the Pathinettampadi . But of late , there seems to have been a deviation from this custom and practice . In order to maintain the sanctity and dignity of this great temple and keep up the past traditions , it is hereby notified that Ayyappans who do not observe the usual Vrithams are prohibited from entering the temple by stepping the Pathinettampadi and women between the ages of ten and fiftyfive are forbidden from entering the temple . ” ” Notification dated 27 November 1956 7 The Kerala High Court in S Mahendran v The Secretary , Travancore Devaswom Board , Thiruvananthapuram , recorded that women between ten and fifty were excluded from the Sabarimala temple . The Petitioners and Respondents in the present case accept that women between the age of ten and fifty are excluded . 30
