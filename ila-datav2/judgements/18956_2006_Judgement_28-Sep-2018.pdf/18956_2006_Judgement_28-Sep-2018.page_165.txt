the footing that it was a charitable , and not a religious organization , and held itself out to be a non - religious organization . Also , the powerful argument addressed , noticed at paragraph 106 of the majority judgment , that persons who joined the Auroville Society did not give up their religion , also added great substance to the fact that the Auroville Society could not be regarded as a religious denomination for the purpose of Article 26 . Chinnappa Reddy , J. alone , in dissent , held the Auroville Society to be a religious denomination , without adverting to the fact that persons who are a part of the Society continued to adhere to their religion . 27 . In these circumstances , we are clearly of the view that there is no distinctive name given to the worshippers of this particular temple ; there is no common faith in the sense of a belief common to a particular religion or section thereof ; or common organization of the worshippers of the Sabarimala temple so as to constitute the said temple into a religious denomination . Also , there are over a thousand other Ayyappa temples in which the deity is worshipped by practicing Hindus of all kinds . It is clear , therefore , that Article 26 does not get attracted to the facts of this case . 70
