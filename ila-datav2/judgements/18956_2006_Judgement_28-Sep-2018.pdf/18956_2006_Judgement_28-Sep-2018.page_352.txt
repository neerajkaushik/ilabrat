( viii ) ( ix ) alia submitted that if women as a class were prohibited from participation , it would amount to social discrimination . However , this is not so in the present case . Girls below 10 years , and women after 50 years can freely enter this Temple , and offer worship Further , there is no similar restriction on the entry of women at the other Temples of Lord Ayyappa . The classification of women between the ages of 10 to 50 years , and men of the same age group , has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved , which is to preserve the identity and manifestation of the Lord as a ‘ Naishtik Brahmacharv ’ . It was submitted by the Respondents that in order to preserve the character of the deity , and the sanctity of the idol at the Sabarimala Temple , the limited restriction is imposed on the entry of women only during the period notified by the Travancore Devaswom Board . There is no absolute restriction on women per se . Such practise is consistent with the ‘ Nishta ’ or ‘ Naishtik Buddhi of the deity . This being the underlying reason behind the custom , there is no derogation of the dignity of women . It is only to protect the manifestation and form of the deity , which is sacred and divine , and preserve the penance undertaken by the devotees . It was further submitted that it is the duty of the Travancore Devaswom Board under Section 31 of the Travancore - Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act , 1950 to administer the temple in accordance with the custom and usage of the Temple . 16
