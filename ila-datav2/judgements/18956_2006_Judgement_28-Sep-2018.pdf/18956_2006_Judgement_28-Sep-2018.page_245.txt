PART G journey ® ® which according to the Court could not be completed by women for physiological reasons . This claim falls foul of the requirement that the practice claiming constitutional protection must be on strictly religious grounds . Of significant importance , is that such a claim is deeply rooted in a stereotypical ( and constitutionally flawed ) notion that women are the ‘ weaker ’ sex and may not undertake tasks that are ‘ too arduous ’ for them . This paternalistic approach is contrary to the constitutional guarantee of equality and dignity to women . Interpreting the Constitution in accordance with the values that infuse it requires that the dignity of women , which is an emanation of Article 15 and founded in Article 21 , can not be disassociated from the exercise of religious freedom . Holding that stereotypical understandings of sex hold no legitimate claim under our Constitution , one of us ( Chandrachud J ) in Navtej Singh v Union of India , ° ” held : “ A discriminatory act will be tested against constitutional values . A discrimination will not survive constitutional scrutiny when it is grounded in and perpetuates stereotypes about a class constituted by the grounds prohibited in Article 15(1 ) . If any ground of discrimination , whether direct or indirect is founded on a stereotypical understanding of the role of the sex , it would not be distinguishable from the discrimination which is prohibited by Article 15 on the grounds only of sex . If certain characteristics grounded in stereotypes , are to be associated with entire classes of people constituted as groups by any of the grounds prohibited in Article 15(1 ) , that can not establish a permissible reason to discriminate . ” 56 Ibid , at paras 38 , 43 57 Writ Petition ( Criminal ) No . 76 of 2016 74
