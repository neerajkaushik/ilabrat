PART K 13(1 ) . Justice Gajendragadkar , however , held that ‘ laws in force ’ in Article 13(1 ) is a compendious expression for statutory laws . In doing so , the learned Judge overlooked the wide ambit that was to be attributed to the term ‘ laws in force ’ , by reason of the inclusive definition . The decision of the Constitution Bench in Sant Ram emphasizes precisely this facet . Hence , the view of Justice Gajendragadkar as a judge of the Bombay High Court in Narasu can not be held to be correct . 98 Recently , in Shayara Bano , a Constitution Bench considered whether talaq — ul — biddat or ‘ triple talaq ’ , which authorised a Muslim man to divorce his wife by pronouncing the word “ talaq ” thrice , was legally invalid . In a 3 - 2 verdict , the majority ruled that triple talaq is not legally valid . Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman ( writing for himself and Justice Lalit ) held that the Muslim Personal Law ( Shariat ) Application Act , 1937 codified the practice of Triple Talaq . The learned Judge proceeded to examine whether this violated the Constitution : “ A7.It is , therefore , clear that all forms of Talaq recognized and enforced by Muslim personal law are recognized and enforced by the 1937 Act . This would necessarily include Triple Talaq when it comes to the Muslim personal law applicable to Sunnis in India ... 149 48.As we have concluded that the 1937 Act is a law made by the legislature before the Constitution came into force , it would fall squarely within the expression “ laws in force ” in Article 13(3)(b ) and would be hit by Article 13(1 ) if found to be inconsistent with the provisions of Part Ill of the Constitution , to the extent of such inconsistency . ”'44 143 Ibid , at page 65 144 Ibid , at page 65 140
