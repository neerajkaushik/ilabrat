PART N N Conclusion 113 The Constitution embodies a vision of social transformation . It represents a break from a history marked by the indignation and discrimination attached to certain identities and serves as a bridge to a vision of a just and equal citizenship . In a deeply divided society marked by intermixing identities such as religion , race , caste , sex and personal characteristics as the sites of discrimination and oppression , the Constitution marks a perception of a new social order . This social order places the dignity of every individual at the heart of its endeavours . As the basic unit of the Constitution , the individual is the focal point through which the ideals of the Constitution are realized . The framers had before them the task of ensuring a balance between individual rights and claims of a communitarian nature . The Constituent Assembly recognised that the recognition of a truly just social order situated the individual as the ‘ backbone of the state , the pivot , the cardinal center of all social activity , whose happiness and satisfaction should be the goal of every social mechanism . ’ ' ® In forming the base and the summit of the social pyramid , the dignity of every individual illuminates the constitutional order and its aspirations for a just social order . Existing structures of social discrimination must be evaluated through the prism of constitutional morality . The effect and endeavour is to produce a society marked by compassion for every individual . 166 Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant ( Member , Constituent Assembly ) in a speech to the Constituent Assembly on 24 January , 1947 159
