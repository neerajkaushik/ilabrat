women between the age group of 10 to 50 to worship in the temple had been established . This was further sanctified by Devaprasnams conducted at Sabarimala by astrologers , who reported that the deity does not like young ladies entering the precincts of the temple . It was then held in paragraph 38 that since women of the age group of 10 to 50 years would not be able to observe Vratham for a period of 41 days due to physiological reasons , they were not permitted to go on a pilgrimage of Sabarimala . It was also held that the deity is in the form of a Naisthik Brahmachari , as a result of which , young women should not offer worship in the temple , so that even the slightest deviation from celibacy and austerity observed by the deity is not caused by the presence of such women . The conclusion of the Division Bench in paragraph 44 was , therefore , as follows : â€œ 44 . Our conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) The restriction imposed on women aged above 10 and below 50 from trekking the holy hills of Sabarimala and offering worship at Sabarimala Shrine is in accordance with the usage prevalent from time immemorial . ( 2 ) Such restriction imposed by the Devaswom Board is not violative of Articles 15 , 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India . 59
