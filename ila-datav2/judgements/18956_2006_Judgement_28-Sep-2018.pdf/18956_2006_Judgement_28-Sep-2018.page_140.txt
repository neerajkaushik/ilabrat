The vision of the founding fathers of the Constitution to liberate the society from blind and ritualistic adherence to mere traditional superstitious beliefs sans reason or rational basis has found expression in the form of Article 17 . The legal position that the protection under Articles 25 and 26 extends a guarantee for rituals and observances , ceremonies and modes of worship which are integral parts of religion and as to what really constitutes an essential part of religion or religious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the doctrine of a particular religion or practices regarded as parts of religion , came to be equally firmly laid down . 17 . Where a temple has been constructed and consecrated as per Agamas , it is considered necessary to perform the daily rituals , poojas and recitations as required to maintain the sanctity of the idol and it is not that in respect of any and every temple any such uniform rigour of rituals can be sought to be enforced , dehors its origin , the manner of construction or method of consecration . No doubt only a qualified person well versed and properly trained for the purpose alone can perform poojas in the temple since he has not only to enter into the sanctum sanctorum but also touch the idol installed therein . It therefore goes without saying that what is required and expected of one to perform the rituals and conduct poojas is to know the rituals to be performed and mantras , as necessary , to be recited for the particular deity and the method of worship ordained or fixed therefor . For example , in Saivite temples or Vaishnavite temples , only a person who learnt the necessary rites and mantras conducive to be performed and recited in the respective temples 45
