Constitution Bench of seven Judges in Commissioner , Hindu Religious Endowments , Madras v. Shri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt ( supra ) , and a Constitution Bench of five Judges in Ratilal Panachand Gandhi v. The State of Bombay & Ors.3 ! . Mr. Seervai comments as under : “ 12.18 ... Although it was wholly unnecessary to do so , Gajendragadkar , J. said : ... it may not be out of place incidentally to strike a note of caution and observe that in order that the practises in question should be treated as a part of religion they must be regarded by the said religion as its essential and integral part ; otherwise even purely secular practises which are not an essential or an integral part of religion are apt to be clothed with a religious form and may make a claim for being treated as religious practises within the meaning of Article 26 . Similarly , even practises though religious may have sprung from merely superstitious beliefs and may in that sense be extraneous and unessential accretions to religion itself . Unless such practises are found to constitute an essential and integral part of a religion their claim for the protection under Article 26 may have to be carefully scrutinised ; in other words , the protection must be confined to such religious practises as are an essential and an integral part of it and no other . It is submitted that the above obiter runs directly counter to the judgment of Mukherjea , J. in the Shirur_Mutt Case _ and substitutes the view of the court for the view of the denomination on what is essentially _ a_matter of religion . The reference to superstitious practises is singularly unfortunate , for what_is ‘ superstition ’ to one section of the public may be a matter of fundamental_religious belief to another . Thus , for nearly 300 years bequests for masses for the soul of a testator were held void as being for superstitious uses , till that view was overruled by the House of Lords in Bourne v. Keane . It is submitted that in dealing with the practise of religion protected by provisions like those contained in s. 116 , Commonwealth of Australia Act or in Article 26(b ) of our Constitution , it_is necessary to bear in_mind_the observations of Latham_C.J. quoted earlier , namely , that those provisions must be regarded as operating in relation to all aspects of religion , irrespective of varying opinions in the community as to the truth of a particular religious doctrine or the goodness of conduct prescribed by a                      31.1954 SCR 1055 : AIR 1954 SC 388 35
