PART H H.1 Do the devotees of Lord Ayyappa constitute a _ religious denomination ? 65 Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi , learned Senior Counsel submitted that devotees who undertake a forty one day penance form a denomination or section called “ Ayyappaswamis ” and the common organisation is the organisation of ‘ Ayyappas ’ . He submits that the ‘ Ayyappas ’ believe in a common faith and hold the belief that if they undertake the penance of forty - one days in the manner prescribed , by maintaining themselves pure and unpolluted , they would be one with Lord Ayyappa . It has been submitted by Mr K Parasaran , learned Senior Counsel that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa hold a sacred religious belief that the deity at Sabarimala is celibate - a Naishtika Brahmachari - who practises strict penance and the strictest form of celibacy , in which he can not find himself in the presence of young women . It has been submitted that Lord Ayyappa has female devotees . Hence , girls below the age of ten and women above the age of fifty would be included as members of the denomination . However , it is unclear as to how they may be considered as members of a denomination that seeks their exclusion . The judgements of this Court lay down that the collective of individuals must have a common faith and set of beliefs that aid their spiritual well - being . It is implausible that women should leave the membership of a common faith , which is meant to be conducive to their spiritual growth for a period of forty years and resume 85
