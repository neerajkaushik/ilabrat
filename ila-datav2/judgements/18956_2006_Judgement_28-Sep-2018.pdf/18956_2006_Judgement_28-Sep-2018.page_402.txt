13.14 . 13.15 . published in two parts in 1893 and 1901 . The Kerala High Court in the case of S. Mahendran v. The Secretary , Travancore Devaswom Board , Thiruvananthapuram & Ors . ( supra ) has recorded as follows : “ The testimony of three persons who have direct and personal knowledge about the usage in the temple is therefore available before this Court . Of them one is the Thanthri_of the temple who can authoritatively speak about the usage followed in the temple . His knowledge extends to a period of more than 40 years . The Secretary of the Ayyappa Seva Sangham had been a regular pilgrim to Sabarimala shrine for a period of 60 years . A_senior member of the Pandalam _ palace has also _ testified about the practise followed and the view of the members of the palace _ to which _ the_temple_at_one _ time belonged . The testimony of these witnesses _ would_therefore _ conclusively establish the usage followed in the temple of not permitting women of the age group 10 to 50 to worship in the temple . It necessarily flows that women of that age group were also not permitted either to enter the precincts of the temple or to trek Sabarimala for the purpose of pilgrimage . ” ( Emphasis supplied )                        In the present case , the character of the temple at Sabarimala is unique on the basis of centuries old religious practises followed to preserve the manifestation of the deity , and the worship associated with it . Any interference with the mode and manner of worship of this religious denomination , or sect , would impact the character of the Temple , and affect the beliefs and practises of the worshippers of this Temple . Based on the material adduced before this Court , the Respondents have certainly made out a plausible case that the practise of restricting entry of women between the age group of 10 to 50 years is an essential religious practise of the devotees of Lord Ayyappa at the Sabarimala Temple being followed since time immemorial . 66
