42 violated . What has been said in Seshammal [ Seshammal v. State of T.N. , ( 1972 ) 2 SCC 11 ] ( supra ) is that if any prescription with regard to appointment of Archakas is made by the Agamas , Section 28 of the Tamil Nadu Act mandates the trustee to conduct the temple affairs in accordance with such custom or usage . The requirement of constitutional conformity is inbuilt and if a custom or usage is outside the protective umbrella afforded and envisaged by Articles 25 and 26 , the law would certainly take its own course . The constitutional legitimacy , naturally , must supersede all religious beliefs or practices . ” 63 . In reply to the contention of the respondents that the basis for exclusion of women is that women can not observe the 41 days Vruthum and also on the ground that Ayyappa is a celibate God , the applicant / intervenor has submitted that the meaning of celibacy is the abstinence from sex and the respondents by suggesting that women can not practice Vruthum which requires abstinence from sex are stigmatizing women and stereotyping them as being weak and lesser human beings than men . Hence , the classification , in view of the applicant / intervenor , is not based on intelligible differentia . 64 . The applicant / intervenor has also submitted that menstruating women and untouchables are being treated as similar in terms of entry to temple and , hence , the custom in dispute amounts to ‘ untouchability ’ .
