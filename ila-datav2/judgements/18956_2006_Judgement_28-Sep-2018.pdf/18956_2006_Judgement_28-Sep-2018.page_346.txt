( i ) The Sabarimala Temple , dedicated to Lord Ayyappa , is a prominent temple in Kerala which is visited by over twenty million pilgrims and devotees every year . As per a centuries old tradition of this temple , and the ‘ acharas ’ , beliefs and customs followed by this Temple , women in the age group of 10 to 50 years are not permitted to enter this Temple . This is attributable to the manifestation of the deity at the Sabarimala Temple which is in the form of a ‘ Naishtik Bramhacharv , who practises strict penance , and the severest form of celibacy . According to legend , it is believed that Lord Ayyappa , the presiding deity of Sabarimala had his human sojourn at Pandalam as the son of the King of Pandalam , known by the name of Manikandan , who found him as a radiant faced infant on the banks of the river Pampa , wearing a bead ( ‘ mani ) around his neck . Manikandan ’s feats and achievements convinced the King and others of his divine origin . The Lord told the King that he could construct a temple at Sabarimala , north of the holy river Pampa , and install the deity there . The King duly constructed the temple at Sabarimala and dedicated it to Lord Ayyappa . The deity of Lord Ayyappa in Sabarimala Temple was installed in the form of a ‘ Naishtik Brahmachar ? i.e. an eternal celibate . Lord Ayyappa is believed to have explained the manner in which the pilgrimage to the Sabarimala Temple is to be undertaken , after observing a 41-day ‘ Vratham ’ . 10
