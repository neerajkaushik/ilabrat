Though the Constitution abolished untouchability and other forms of social oppression for the marginalised and for the Dalits , the quest for dignity is yet a daily struggle . The conditions that reproduce “ untouchability ” are still in existence . Though the Constitution guarantees to every human being dignity as inalienable to existence , the indignity and social prejudices which Dalits face continue to haunt their lives . Seventy years after independence , a section of Dalits has been forced to continue with the indignity of manual scavenging . In a recent work , “ Ants Among Elephants : An Untouchable Family and the Making of Modern India ’ , Sujatha Gidla describes the indignified life of a manual scavenger : “ As their brooms wear down , they have to bend their backs lower and lower to sweep . When their baskets start to leak , the [ human ] shit drips down their faces . In the rainy season , the filth runs all over these people , onto their hair , their noses , their moths . Tuberculosis and infectious diseases are endemic among them . ” ! © ° The demeaning life of manual scavengers is narrated by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears in “ Where India Goes : Abandoned Toilets , Stunted Development and the Costs of Caste ” ' ® ' .
