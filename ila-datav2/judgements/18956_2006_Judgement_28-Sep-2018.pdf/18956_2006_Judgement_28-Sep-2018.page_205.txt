PART C 27 _ The legality of banning the entry of women above the age of ten and below the age of fifty to offer worship at Sabarimala shrine was sought to be answered in 1992 by a Division Bench of the High Court of Kerala in S Mahendran v _ The Secretary , Travancore Devaswom _ Board , Thiruvananthapuram ( “ Mahendran ” ) . ' ° A public interest litigation was entertained by the High Court on the basis of a petition addressed by one S. Mahendran . Upholding the exclusion of women from the ceremonies and prayer at the shrine , the High Court concluded : “ 44 . Our conclusions are as follows : ( 1 ) The restriction imposed on women aged above 10 and below 50 from trekking the holy hills of Sabarimala and offering worship at Sabarimala Shrine is in accordance with the usage prevalent from time immemorial . ( 2 ) Such restriction imposed by the Devaswom Board is not violative of Articles 15 , 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India . ( 3 ) Such restriction is also not violative of the provisions of Hindu Place of Public Worship ( Authorisation of Entry ) Act , 1965 since there is no restriction between one section and another section or between one class and another class among the Hindus in the matter of entry to a temple whereas the prohibition is only in respect of women of a particular age group and not women as a class . ” The High Court issued the following directions : “ In the light of the aforesaid conclusions we direct the first respondent , the Travancore Devaswom Board , not to permit women above the age of 10 and below the age of 50 to trek the holy hills of Sabarimala in connection with the pilgrimage to the Sabarimala temple and from offering worship at Sabarimala Shrine during any period of the year . We also direct the 3rd respondent , Government of Kerala , to render all necessary assistance inclusive of police and to see that the direction which we have issued to the Devaswom Board is implemented and complied with . ” 10 AIR 1993 Ker 42 " 1 Ibid , at page 57 34
