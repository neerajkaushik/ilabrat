They can therefore be regarded , as has been held in Sri Adi Visheshwara ( supra ) , as Hindus who worship the idol of Lord Ayyappa as part of the Hindu religious form of worship but not as denominational worshippers . The same goes for members of other religious communities . We may remember that in Durgah Committee ( supra ) , this Court had held that since persons of all religious faiths visit the Durgah as a place of pilgrimage , it may not be easy to hold that they constitute a religious denomination or a section thereof . However , for the purpose of the appeal , they proposed to deal with the dispute between the parties on the basis that the Chishtia sect , whom the respondents represented , were a separate religious denomination , being a sub - sect of Soofies . We may hasten to add that we find no such thing here . We may also add that in S.P.
