PART N 116 The Constitution seeks to achieve a transformed society based on equality and justice to those who are victims of traditional belief systems founded in graded inequality . It reflects a guarantee to protect the dignity of all individuals who have faced systematic discrimination , prejudice and social exclusion . Construed in this context , the prohibition against untouchability marks a powerful guarantee to remedy the stigmatization and exclusion of individuals and groups based on hierarchies of the social structure . Notions of purity and pollution have been employed to perpetuate discrimination and prejudice against women . They have no place in a constitutional order . In acknowledging the inalienable dignity and worth of every individual , these notions are prohibited by the guarantee against untouchability and by the freedoms that underlie the Constitution . In civic as in social life , women have been subjected to prejudice , stereotypes and social exclusion . In religious life , exclusionary traditional customs assert a claim to legitimacy which owes its origin to patriarchal structures . These forms of discrimination are not mutually exclusive . The intersection of identities in social and religious life produces a unique form of discrimination that denies women an equal citizenship under the Constitution . Recognizing these forms of intersectional discrimination is the first step towards extending constitutional protection against discrimination attached to intersecting identities . 161
