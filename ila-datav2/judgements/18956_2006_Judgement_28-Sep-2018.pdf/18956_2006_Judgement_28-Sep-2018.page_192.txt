PART A allowing the right to worship to men is to place women in a position of subordination . The Constitution , should not become an instrument for the perpetuation of patriarchy . The freedom to believe , the freedom to be a person of faith and the freedom of worship , are attributes of human liberty . Facets of that liberty find protection in Article 25 . Religion then can not become a cover to exclude and to deny the basic right to find fulfilment in worship to women . Nor can a physiological feature associated with a woman provide a constitutional rationale to deny to her the right to worship which is available to others . Birth marks and physiology are irrelevant to constitutional entitlements which are provided to every individual . To exclude from worship , is to deny one of the most basic postulates of human dignity to women . Neither can the Constitution countenance such an exclusion nor can a free society accept it under the veneer of religious beliefs . 16 Much of our jurisprudence on religion has evolved , as we shall see , around what constitutes an essential religious practice . At a certain level an adjudication of what is a religious practice seems to have emerged from the distinction made in clause 2(a ) of Article 25 between a religious practice and economic , financial , political or other secular activities which are associated with religious practices . Where the state has enacted a law by which it claims to have regulated a secular activity associated with a religious practice , but not the religious practice , it becomes necessary to decide the issue , where the validity of the law is challenged . Similarly , Article 26(b ) speaks of “ matters of religion ” 21
