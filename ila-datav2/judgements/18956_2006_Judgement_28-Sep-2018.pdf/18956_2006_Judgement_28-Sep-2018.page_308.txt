PART K The Constituent Assembly also had a legislative precedent of the Government of India Act 1935 , from which several provisions of the Constitution are designed . Section 292 of that Act , which corresponds broadly to Article 372(1 ) of the Constitution reads thus : “ 292 . Notwithstanding the repeal by this Act of the Government of India Act , but subject to the other provisions of this Act , all the law in force in British India immediately before the commencement of Part Ill of this Act shall continue in force in British India until altered or repealed or amended by a competent Legislature or other competent authority . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) Section 292 of the Act saved ‘ all the law in force ’ in British India immediately before the commencement of Part III of that Act . The expression “ law in force ” in that Section was interpreted by the Federal Court in The United Provinces v Mst . Atiqa Begum . ' ® ° The question before the Court was whether the legislature of the United Provinces was competent to enact the Regularization of Remissions Act 1938 . While construing Section 292 of the Government of India Act 1935 and adverting to the powers of the Provincial Legislature and the Central Legislature , Justice Suleman held : “ Even though we are not concerned with the wisdom of the Legislature , one can not help saying that there appears to be no adequate reason why the power to give retrospective effect to a new legislation should be curtailed , limited or minimized , particularly when S. 292 applies not only to statutory enactments then in force , but to all laws , including even personal laws , customary laws , and common laws . ”'9 ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 136 AIR 1941 FC 16 187 Ibid , at page 31 137
