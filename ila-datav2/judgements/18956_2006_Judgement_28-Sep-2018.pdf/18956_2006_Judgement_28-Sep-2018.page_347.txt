It is believed that Lord Ayyappa himself undertook the 41-day ‘ Vratham ’ before he went to Sabarimala Temple to merge with the deity . The whole process of the pilgrimage undertaken by a pilgrim is to replicate the journey of Lord Ayyappa . The mode and manner of worship at this Temple as revealed by the Lord himself is chronicled in the ‘ Sthal Purana ’ i.e. the ‘ Bhuthanatha Geetha ’ . The 41 day “ Vratham ” is a centuries old custom and practise undertaken by the pilgrims referred to as ‘ Ayyappans ’ . The object of this ‘ Vratham ’ is to discipline and train the devotees for the evolution of spiritual consciousness leading to self - realization . Before embarking on the pilgrimage to this shrine , a key essential of the ‘ Vratham ’ is observance of a ‘ Sathvic ’ lifestyle and ‘ Brahmacharya ’ so as to keep the body and mind pure . A basic requirement of the ‘ Vratham ’ is to withdraw from the materialistic world and step onto the spiritual path . When a pilgrim undertakes the ‘ Vratham ’ , the pilgrim separates himself from the women - folk in the house , including his wife , daughter , or other female members in the family . The “ Vratham ’ or penance consists of : e Forsaking all physical relations with one ’s spouse ; e Giving up anything that is intoxicating , including alcohol , cigarettes and ‘ tamasic ’ food ; e Living separately from the rest of the family in an isolated room or a separate building ; 11
