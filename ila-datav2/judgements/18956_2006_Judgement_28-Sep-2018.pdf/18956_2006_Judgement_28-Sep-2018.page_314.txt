PART K detract from the transformative vision of the Constitution be granted supremacy over it ? To my mind , the answer to all these , is in the negative . The individual , as the basic unit , is at the heart of the Constitution . All rights and guarantees of the Constitution are operationalized and are aimed towards the self - realization of the individual . This makes the anti - exclusion principle firmly rooted in the transformative vision of the Constitution , and at the heart of judicial enquiry . Irrespective of the source from which a practice claims legitimacy , this principle enjoins the Court to deny protection to practices that detract from the constitutional vision of an equal citizenship . 101 The decision in Narasu , in restricting the definition of the term ‘ laws in force ’ detracts from the transformative vision of the Constitution . Carving out ‘ custom or usage ’ from constitutional scrutiny , denies the constitutional vision of ensuring the primacy of individual dignity . The decision in Narasu , is based on flawed premises . Custom or usage can not be excluded from ‘ laws in force ’ . The decision in Narasu also opined that personal law is immune from constitutional scrutiny . This detracts from the notion that no body of practices can claim supremacy over the Constitution and its vision of ensuring the sanctity of dignity , liberty and equality . This also overlooks the wide ambit that was to be attributed 143
