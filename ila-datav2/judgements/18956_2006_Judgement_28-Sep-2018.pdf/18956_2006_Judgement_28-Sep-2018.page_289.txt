PART J 84 In Ardeshir H Bhiwandiwala v State of Bombay , ' ' ® a Constitution Bench of this Court considered whether the Petitioner 's salt works could be included within the definition of ‘ factory ’ in Section 2(m ) of the Factories Act , 1948 . Section 2(m ) defines ‘ factory ’ as “ any premises including the precincts thereof ’ . This Court rejected the appellant ’s claim that the salt works could not have precincts , being open lands and not premises : “ 6.The expression “ premises including precincts ” does not necessarily mean that the premises must always have precincts . Even buildings need not have any precincts . The word “ including ” is not a term restricting the meaning of the word “ premises ” but is a term which enlarges the scope of the word “ premises ” . We are therefore of opinion that even this contention is not sound and does not lead to the only conclusion that the word “ premises ” must be restricted to mean buildings and be not taken to cover open land as well . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) In CIT v Taj Mahal Hotel , Secunderabad " ' ® a two judge Bench of this Court considered whether sanitary and pipeline fittings would fall within the definition of ‘ plant ’ under Section 10(5 ) of the Income Tax Act , 1922 . Section 10(5 ) of the Act provided inter alia that in Section 10(2 ) the word “ plant ” includes “ vehicles , books , scientific apparatus and surgical equipment purchased for the purpose of the business , profession or vocation ” . While answering the above question in the affirmative , this Court held that : “ 6.The word “ includes ” is often used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of the words or phrases occurring in the body of the statute . When it is so used , those words and phrases must be construed as comprehending not only such things as they signify according 115 ( 1961 ) 3 SCR 592 116 ( 1971 ) 3 SCC 550 118
