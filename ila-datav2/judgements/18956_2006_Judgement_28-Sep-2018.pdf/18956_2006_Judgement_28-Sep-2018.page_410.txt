The Respondents and the Intervenors have made out a plausible case that the Ayyappans or worshippers of the Sabarimala Temple satisfy the requirements of being a religious denomination , or sect thereof , which is entitled to the protection provided by Article 26 . This is a mixed question of fact and law which ought to be decided before a competent court of civil jurisdiction . The limited restriction on the entry of women during the notified agegroup does not fall within the purview of Article 17 of the Constitution . 74
