PART F 39 = In Tilkayat Shri Govindlalji Maharaj v State of Rajasthan ( “ Tilkayat ” ) * " , a Constitution Bench of this Court dealt with a challenge to Nathdwara Temple Act 1959 , which provides for the appointment of a board to manage the affairs of the temple and its property . The Petitioner , the spiritual head of the temple , claimed that the temple and its properties were private and that the State legislature was not competent to pass the law . He contended that even if the temple was held to be a public temple , the Act infringed Articles 25 , 26(b ) and 26(c ) because the temple was managed by the Tilkayat as head of the Vallabh denomination .

In cases where conflicting evidence is produced in respect of rival contentions as to competing religious practices the Court may not be able to resolve the dispute by a blind application of the formula that the community decides which practice is an integral part of its religion , because the community may speak with more than one voice and the formula would therefore break down . The question will always have to be decided by the Court ... ” 31 ( 1964 ) 1 SCR 561 57
