“ According to the Agamas , an image becomes defiled if there is any departure or violation of any of the rules relating to worship , and _ purificatory ceremonies ( known as Samprokshana ) have to be performed for restoring the sanctity of the shrine . Vide judgment of Sadasiva Aiyar , J. , in Gopala Muppanar v. Subramania Aiyar [ ( 1914 ) 27 MLJ 253 ] . In Sankaralinga Nadan v. Raja Rajeswara Dorai [ ( 1908 ) L.R. 35 I.A. 176 ] , it was held by the Privy Council affirming the judgment of the Madras High Court that a trustee who agreed to admit into the temple persons who were not entitled to worship therein , according to the Agamas and the custom of the temple was guilty of breach of trust . Thus , under the ceremonial law pertaining to temples , who are entitled to enter into them for worship and where they are entitled to stand and worship and how the worship is to be conducted are all matters of religion . The conclusion is also implicit in Art . 25 which after declaring that all persons are entitled freely to profess , practice and propagate religion , enacts that this should not affect the operation of any law throwing open Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus . We have dealt with this question at some length in view of the argument of the learned Solicitor - General that exclusion of persons from temple has not been shown to be a matter of religion with reference to the tenets of Hinduism . We must , accordingly hold that if the rights of the appellants have to be determined solely with reference to Art 26(b ) , then section 3 of Act V of 1947 , should be held to be bad as infringing it . ” ( emphasis supplied ) ( at pp . 910 - 911 ) 20
