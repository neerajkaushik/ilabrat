A Constitution Bench of five - Judges in Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited & Ors . v. Securities and Exchange Board of India & Anr#2 had highlighted the role of this Court as an institution tasked with balancing the various Fundamental Rights , guaranteed under Part III . It was noted that : “ 25 . At the outset , it may be stated that Supreme Court is not only the sentinel of the fundamental rights but also a balancing wheel between the rights , subject to social control ... under our Constitution no right in Part III is absolute . Freedom of expression is not an absolute value under our Constitution . It must not be forgotten that no single value , no matter exalted , can bear the full burden of upholding a democratic system of government . Underlying our constitutional system are a number of important values , all of which help to guarantee our liberties , but in ways which sometimes conflict . Under our Constitution , probably , no values are absolute . All important values , therefore , must be qualified and balanced against other important , and often competing , values . ” The Constitutional necessity of balancing various Fundamental Rights has also been emphasised in the decision of this Court in Subramaniam Swamy v. Union of India , Ministry of Law & Ors.*3 . In Acharya Maharajshri Narendra Prasadji Anandprasadji Maharaj & Ors . v. The State of Gujarat & Ors . * * , a Constitution Bench , in the context of Article 26 , noted that it is a duty of this Court to strike a balance , and ensure that Fundamental Rights of one person co - exist in harmony with the exercise of Fundamental Rights of others . 42 ( 2012 ) 10 SCC 603 43 ( 2016 ) 7 SCC 221 44 ( 1975 ) 1 SCC 11 46
