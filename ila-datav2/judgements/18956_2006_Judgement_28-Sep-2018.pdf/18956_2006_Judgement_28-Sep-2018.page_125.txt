practices even though considered essential or vital by those professing the religion . | consider that in the context in which the phrase occurs , it is intended to save the validity only of those laws which do not invade the basic and essential practices of religion which are guaranteed by the operative portion of Art . 25(1 ) for two reasons : ( 1 ) To read the saving as covering even the basic essential practices of religion , would in effect nullify and render meaningless the entire guarantee of religious freedom — a freedom not merely to profess , but to practice religion , for very few pieces of legislation for abrogating religious practices could fail to be subsumed under the caption of “ a provision for social welfare or reform . ” ( 2 ) If the phrase just quoted was intended to have such a wide operation as cutting at even the essentials guaranteed by Art . 25(1 ) , there would have been no need for the special provision as to “ throwing open of Hindu religious institutions ” to all classes and sections of Hindus since the legislation contemplated by this provision would be par excellence one of social reform . In my view by the phrase “ laws providing for social welfare and reform ” it was not intended to enable the legislature to “ reform ” a religion out of existence or identity . Art . 25(2)(a ) having provided for legislation dealing with “ economic , financial , political or secular activity which may be associated with religious practices ” , the succeeding clause proceeds to deal with other activities of religious groups and these also must be those which are associated with religion . Just as the activities referred to in Art . 25(2)(a ) are obviously not of the essence of the religion , similarly the saving in Art . 25(2)(b ) is not intended to cover the basic essentials of the creed of a religion which is protected by Art . 25(1 ) . ” 30
