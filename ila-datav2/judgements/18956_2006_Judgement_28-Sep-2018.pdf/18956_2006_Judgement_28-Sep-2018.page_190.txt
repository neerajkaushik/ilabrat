PART A postulate of the protections which are conferred by Articles 20 , 21 and 22 . Thus the principle which has become an entrenched part of our constitutional doctrine after the decision in Bank Nationalization is based on a sure foundation . The freedoms which we possess and those which we exercise are not disjunctive parts , separate from each other . Individuals in society exercise not one but many of the freedoms . An individual exercises a multitude of freedoms as a composite part of the human personality . A single act embodies within it the exercise of many choices reflecting the assertion of manifold freedoms . From this perspective , it is but a short step to hold that all freedoms exist in harmony . Our freedoms are enveloped in the womb created by the Constitution for the survival of liberty . Hence , the absence of a clause of subjection in Article 26 does not lead to the conclusion that the freedom of a religious denomination exists as a discrete element , divorced from the others . This approach is quite independent of the consideration that even Article 26 like Article 25(1 ) is subject to public order , morality and health . Once we hold , following the line which is now part of conventional doctrine , that all freedoms have linkages and exist in a state of mutual co - existence , the freedom of religious denominations under Article 26 must be read in a manner which preserves equally , other individual freedoms which may be impacted by an unrestrained exercise . Hence , the dignity of women which is an emanation of Article 15 and a reflection of Article 21 can not be disassociated from the exercise of religious freedom under Article 26 . 19
