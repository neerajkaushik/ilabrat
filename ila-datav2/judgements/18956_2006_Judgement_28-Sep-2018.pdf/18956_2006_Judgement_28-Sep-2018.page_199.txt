This involves a trek from the Pampa river , climbing 3000 feet to the Sannidhanam , which is a trek of around 13 Kms , or through forests which is a trek of 41 Kms . It ends with the pilgrim ’s ascending the sacred ” eighteen steps to the shrine for the first darshan or glimpse of the deity . The fourth stage is the return journey and the final incorporation back into life . Modern communications have made the task less arduous . In 1960 , an access road was constructed for vehicles , so that a pilgrim can drive right up to the foot of Sabarimala . From here , the holy summit is just 8 kms away . The Kerala State Transport Corporation runs special buses during the season of pilgrimage . The buses connect Pampa directly with almost all the main cities in Kerala , Tamil Nadu and Karnataka . 24 The pilgrimage has three distinctive features : ( i ) It is almost exclusively a male - centric pilgrimage that bars women between the ages of ten and fifty from participating in the rituals ; ( ii ) Though the worshippers of Lord Ayyappa fall broadly within the Hindu tradition , yet males of all ages may participate on an equal footing , regardless of caste , creed or religion . Muslims and Christians are also known to undertake this pilgrimage , enjoying the same equality ; and ( iii ) The actual journey to the pilgrimage site is preceded by a preparatory period of forty - one days . During this period , pilgrims are obliged to wear black clothes 28
