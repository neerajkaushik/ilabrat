PART | The Interim Report was moved before the Constituent Assembly by Vallabhbhai Patel on 29 April 1947 . Commenting on Clause 6 , one member , Promatha Ranjan Thakur , observed that “ untouchability ” can not be abolished without abolishing the caste system , since “ untouchability ” is its symptom . Srijut Rohini Kumar Chaudhury , SC Banerjee and Dhirendra Nath Datta sought a clarification on the definition of the term “ untouchability ” . Chaudhary even suggested the following amendment to define the term “ untouchability ” : “ Untouchability means any act committed in exercise of discrimination on , grounds of religion , caste or lawful vocation of life mentioned in clause 4 . ” Opposing the amendment , K M Munshi stated that the word “ untouchability ” has been “ put purposely within inverted commas in order to indicate that the Union legislature when it defines ‘ untouchability ’ will be able to deal with it in the sense in which it is normally understood ” ® ° , Subsequently , only three amendments were moved . H V Kamath sought to insert the word “ unapproachability ” after the term “ untouchability ’ and the words “ and every ” after the word “ any ” . S. Nagappa wanted to substitute the words “ imposition of any disability ” with the words “ observance of any disability ” . P Kunhiraman wanted to add the words “ punishable by law ” after the word “ offence ” . Vallabhbhai Patel , who had moved the clause , considered the amendments to be unnecessary and observed : “ The first amendment is by Mr. Kamath . He wants the addition of the word ‘ unapproachability ’ . If untouchability is provided for in the fundamental rights as an offence , all necessary adjustments will be made in the law that may be passed by the Legislature . | do not think it is right or wise to provide for such 80 Constituent Assembly Debates ( 29 April 1947 ) 95
