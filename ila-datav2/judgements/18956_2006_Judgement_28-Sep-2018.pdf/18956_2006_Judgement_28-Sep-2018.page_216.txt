PART F The Court cited with approval the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Adelaide Company of Jehovah ’s Witnesses Incorporated v The Commonwealth of Australia ® * , which held that the Constitution protected not only “ liberty of opinion ” but also “ acts done in pursuance of religious belief as part of religion . ” The court noted the importance of both religious belief and the practice that stems from it , and provided an expansive definition of ‘ religion ’ : “ A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a system of beliefs or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as conducive to their spiritual well - being , but it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else but a doctrine or belief ... The guarantee under our Constitution not only protects the freedom of religious opinion but it protects also acts done in pursuance of a religion and this is made clear by the use of the expression " practice of religion " in article 25 . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) Drawing a distinction between religious and secular practices , the court held that : “ .. What constitutes the essential part of a religion is primarily to be ascertained with reference to the doctrines of that religion itself . If the tenets of any religious sect of the Hindus prescribe that offerings of food should be given to the idol at particular hours of the day ... all these would be regarded as parts of religion and the mere fact that they involve expenditure of money or employment of priests and servants or the use of marketable commodities would not make them secular activities partaking of a commercial or economic character ; all of them are religious practices and should be regarded as matters of religion within the meaning of Article 26(b ) . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 24 [ 1943 ] HCA 12 45
