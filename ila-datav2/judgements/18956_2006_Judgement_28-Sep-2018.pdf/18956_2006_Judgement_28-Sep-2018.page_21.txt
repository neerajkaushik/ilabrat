21 to 50 years based on physiological factors exclusively to be found in female gender violates Article 14 of the Constitution of India , for such a classification does not have a constitutional object . It is also the case of the applicant / intervenor that even if it is said that there is classification between men and women as separate classes , there can not be any further sub - classification among women on the basis of physiological factors such as menstruation by which women below 10 years and above 50 years are allowed . 28 . It has been averred by the applicant / intervenor that as per Article 14 , any law being discriminatory in nature has to have the existence of an intelligible differentia and the same must bear a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved . The object as has been claimed is to prevent the deity from being polluted , which , in the view of the applicant / intervenor , runs counter to the constitutional object of justice , liberty , equality and fraternity as enshrined in the Preamble to our Constitution . That apart , the applicant / intervenor has submitted that though the classification based on menstruation may be intelligible , yet the object sought to be achieved being constitutionally invalid , the question of nexus need not be delved into .
