PART F Speaking with reference to Article 26 , Justice Mukherjea reiterated the broad view taken by the Court in Shirur Mutt — that religious denominations had ‘ complete autonomy ’ to decide which religious practices were essential for them : “ Religious practices or performances of acts in pursuance of religious beliefs are as much a part of religion as faith or belief in particular doctrines ... 23 ... No outside authority has any right to say that these are not essential parts of religion and it is not open to the secular authority of the State to restrict or prohibit them in any manner they like under the guise of administering the trust estate . ” The Court , however , recognized the limited role of the Court in the determination of such a question : 31 “ The distinction between matters of religion and those of secular administration of religious properties may , at times , appear to be a thin one . But in cases of doubt ... the court should take a common sense view and be actuated by considerations of practical necessity . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) The late 1950s witnessed two cases that were central to the evolution of the essential practices doctrine . In Sri Venkataramana Devaru v State of Mysore ” ® ( “ Devaru ” ) , a Constitution Bench of this Court considered the constitutionality of the Madras Temple Entry Authorisation Act , 1947 , which sought to reform the practice of religious exclusion of Dalits from a denominational temple founded by the Gowda Saraswat Brahmins .
