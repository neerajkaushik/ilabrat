PART M constitute an essential part of religion is inconsistent with the liberal values of the Constitution which recognize autonomy in matters of faith and belief . 111   Asimilar critique of the essential religious practices doctrine has been put forth by Professors Faizan Mustafa and Jagteshwar Singh Sohi in a recent publication titled “ Freedom of Religion in India : Current Issues and Supreme Court Acting as Clergy ” . ' ° ° Along similar lines , Jaclyn L Neo in an article titled “ Definitional Imbroglios : A critique of the definition of religion and essential practice tests in religious freedom adjudication ” © has dealt with the flaws of the essential religious practices doctrine . The author notes that definitional tests such as the essential religious practices doctrine are formalistic in nature , leading the court to draw an arbitrary line between protected and non - protected religious beliefs or practices : “ The key distinction between adjudicating religious freedom claims by examining whether the restrictions are permissible under the limitation clauses and adjudicating claims through a definitional test is that the latter precludes a religious freedom claim by determining that it falls outside the scope of a constitutional guarantee , before any consideration could be made concerning the appropriate balance between the right and competing rights or interests . Definitional tests are often formalistic in that courts select a particular set of criteria and make a decision on the religious freedom claim by simply considering whether the religion , belief or practice falls within these criteria . In doing so , the courts therefore could be said to risk drawing an arbitrary line between protected and nonprotected religions , beliefs or practices . ” ' ® ! 159 Faizan Mustafa and Jagteshwar Singh Sohi , Freedom of Religion in India : Current Issues and Supreme Court Acting as Clergy , Brigham Young University Review ( 2017 ) 169 Jaclyn L Neo , Definitional imbroglios : A critique of the definition of religion and essential practice tests in religious freedom adjudication , International Journal of Constitutional Law , Vol . 16 ( 2018 ) , at pages 574 - 595 161 Ibid , at pages 575 , 576 156
