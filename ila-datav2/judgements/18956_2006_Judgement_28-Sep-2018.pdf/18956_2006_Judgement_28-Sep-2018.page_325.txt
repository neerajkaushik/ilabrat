PART M listed public places . Article 17 which abolishes untouchability has a horizontal application which is available against the state as well as non - state entities . Article 23 , Article 24 and Article 25(1 ) are illustrations of horizontal rights intended to secure the dignity of the individual . All these guarantees rest in equilibrium with other fundamental freedoms that the Constitution recognizes : equality under Article 14 , freedoms under Article 19 and life and personal liberty under Article 21 . The individual right to the freedom of religion under Article 25 must rest in mutual co - existence with other freedoms which guarantee above all , the dignity and autonomy of the individual . Article 26 guarantees a group right — the right of a religious denomination . The co - existence of a group right in a chapter on fundamental rights which places the individual at the forefront of its focus can not be a matter without significance . Would the Constitution have intended to preserve the assertion of group rights even at the cost of denigrating individual freedoms ? Should the freedom conferred upon a group - the religious denomination under Article 26(b ) — have such a broad canvas as would allow the denomination to practice exclusion that would be destructive of individual freedom ? The answer to this , in my view , would have to be in the negative for the simple reason that it would be impossible to conceive of the preservation of liberal constitutional values while at the same time allowing group rights to defy those values by practicing exclusion and through customs which are derogatory to dignity . This apparent contradiction can be resolved by postulating that notwithstanding the recognition of group rights in Article 26 , the Constitution has never intended that the assertion of these rights destroy individual dignity and 154
