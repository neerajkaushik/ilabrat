95 the regulations / rules made under Section 4(1 ) shall not discriminate , in any manner whatsoever , against any Hindu on the ground that he / she belongs to a particular section or class . ( xii ) The language of both the provisions , that is , Section 3 and the proviso to Section 4(1 ) of the 1965 Act clearly indicate that custom and usage must make space to the rights of all sections and classes of Hindus to offer prayers at places of public worship . Any interpretation to the contrary would annihilate the purpose of the 1965 Act and incrementally impair the fundamental right to practise religion guaranteed under Article 25(1 ) . Therefore , we hold that Rule 3(b ) of the 1965 Rules is ultra vires the 1965 Act . 145 . In view of the aforesaid analysis and conclusions , the writ petition is allowed . There shall be no order as to costs . ( Dipak Misra ) sisape senesceacee eqneatearne saeeresseare axearsst J. ( A.M. Khanwilkar ) New Delhi ; September 28 , 2018
