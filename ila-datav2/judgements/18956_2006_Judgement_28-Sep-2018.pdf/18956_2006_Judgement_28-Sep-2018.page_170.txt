The present case raises grave issues relating to women generally , who happen to be between the ages of 10 to 50 , and are not allowed entry into the temple at Sabarimala on the ground of a physiological or biological function which is common to all women between those ages . Since this matter raises far - reaching consequences relating to Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India , we have found it necessary to decide this matter on merits . Consequently , this technical plea can not stand in the way of a constitutional court applying constitutional principles to the case at hand . 31 . A fervent plea was made by some of the counsels for the Respondents that the Court should not decide this case without any evidence being led on both sides . Evidence is very much there , in the form of the writ petition and the affidavits that have been filed in the writ petition , both by the Petitioners as well as by the Board , and by the Thanthri â€™s affidavit referred to supra . It must not be forgotten that a writ petition filed under either Article 32 or Article 226 is itself not merely a pleading , but also evidence in the form of affidavits that are sworn .
