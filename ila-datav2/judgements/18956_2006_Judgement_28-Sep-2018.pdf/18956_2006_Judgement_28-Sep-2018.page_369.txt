observations of Chinnappa Reddy , J. are _ instructive understanding the true role of this Court in matters of religion : “ 19 ... We may refer here to the observations of Latham , C.J. in Adelaide Company of Jehovah ’s Witnesses v. The Commonwealth , a decision of the Australian High Court quoted by Mukherjea , J. in the Shirur Mutt case . Latham , C.J. had said : The _ Constitution protects religion within _ a_community organised under a Constitution , so that the continuance of such _ protection _ necessarily_assumes_the_continuance_of the community _ so organised . This view makes it possible to reconcile religious freedom with ordered government . It does not mean that the mere fact that the Commonwealth Parliament passes a law in the belief that it will promote peace , order and good government of Australia precludes any consideration by a court of the question whether that question by Parliament would remove all reality from the constitutional guarantee . That guarantee is intended to limit the sphere of action of the legislature . The interpretation _ and_application of the _ quarantee can not , under _ our Constitution , be left to Parliament . If the quarantee is to have any real significance it must be left to the courts of justice to determine its meaning and to give effect _ to it by declaring the invalidity of laws which infringes it and _ by declining to enforce them . The courts will therefore have the responsibility of determining whether a particular law can fairly be regarded , as a law to protect the existence of the community , or whether , on the other hand , it is a law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion ... What Latham , C.J. has said about the responsibility of the court accords with what we have said about the function of the court when a claim to the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 25 is put forward ... ... 20 ... In Ratilal ’s case we also notice that Mukherjea , J. quoted as appropriate Davar , J. ’s following observations in Jamshed Ji v. Soonabai : If_this_is _ the belief of the Zoroastrian community , - a secular Judge is bound to accept that belief — it is not for him _ to_sit in judgment on that belief , he_has_no right to interfere with the conscience of a donor who makes a gift in favour of what he believes to be the advancement of his religion and the welfare of his community or mankind . We do endorse the view suggested by Davar , J. ’s observation that the question is not whether a particular religious belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as a part of the profession or practise of religion . Our personal views and_reactions are                                                    33 in
