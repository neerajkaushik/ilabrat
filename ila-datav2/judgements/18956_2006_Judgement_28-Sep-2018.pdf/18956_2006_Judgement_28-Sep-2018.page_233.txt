Rejecting the claim that Shirur Mutt laid down the proposition that all practices arising out of religion are afforded constitutional protection , the Court held : “ 18 ... The attempted exercise by the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant to read into the decisions of this Court in Shirur Mutt 's case ( supra ) and others something more than what it actually purports to lay down as if they lend support to assert or protect any and everything claimed as being part of the religious rituals , rites , observances and method of worship and make such claims immutable from any restriction or regulation based on the other provisions of the Constitution or the law enacted to implement such constitutional mandate , deserves only to be rejected as merely a superficial approach by purporting to deride what otherwise has to have really an overriding effect , in the scheme of rights declared and guaranteed under Part Ill of the Constitution of India . Any custom or usage irrespective of even any proof of their existence in pre constitutional days can not be countenanced as a source of law to claim any rights when it is found to violate human rights , dignity , social equality and the specific mandate of the Constitution and law made by Parliament . No usage which is found to be pernicious and considered to be in derogation of the law of the land or opposed to public policy or social decency can be accepted or upheld by courts in the country . ”% ® ( Emphasis supplied ) 44 The question of the essential religious nature of the Tandava dance was considered again in 2004 , in Commissioner of Police v.
