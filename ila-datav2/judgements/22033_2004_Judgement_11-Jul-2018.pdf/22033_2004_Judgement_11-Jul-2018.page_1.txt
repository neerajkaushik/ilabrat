NON -REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO . 8505 OF 2009    SHEIKH YAKUB(D ) BY LRS . Appellant(s ) VERSUS SAKINABI ( D ) BY LRS . Respondent(s ) JUDGMENT KURIAN , J. 1 . The trial court and the High Court have entered a clear finding that late Mariyambi could not prove the factum of oral gift . Despite being the donee , she did not mount the box to prove the oral gift . The Sale Deed executed by her in the year 1978 does not trace her title to the oral gift . The Record of Rights also does not support the case of Mariyambi on the oral gift . 2 . Therefore , we do not find any justification to disturb such findings in the absence of any other counter evidence . The appeal is , hence , dismissed . = e om om Ae A Sm OR Ue Oe ae Eee ee Ji â€˜ on [ SANJAY KISHAN KAUL ] New Delhi ; July 11 , 2018 .
