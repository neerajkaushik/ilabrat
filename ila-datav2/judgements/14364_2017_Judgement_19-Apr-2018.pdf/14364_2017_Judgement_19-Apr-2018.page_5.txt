for two consecutive years or using the services below the minimum level as may be prescribed in the rules or the bye - laws ; ( b ) has not attended three consecutive general meetings of the society and such absence has not been condoned by the members in _ the general meeting . " Thus only members who have not attended at least any one of the three consecutive general body meetings of the society are alone ineligible to continue as a member of the Co - operative Bank . The exclusion of 583 members from the preliminary voters list in the final voters list on the basis of the misinterpretation of the statutory provision is prima facie illegal . 3 . An Annual General Body Meeting has obviously to be convened for the purpose of election in the prescribed manner as per Section 29(1)(b ) of the Kerala Co - operative Societies Act . But the quorum for a General Meeting in order to transact business therein is 50 as per Clause 22 of the bye - laws of the Co - operative Bank in question . No election can be conducted even if all the 28 members are present in the General Meeting when the number falls short of 50 as the quorum specified in the bye - laws . The General Meeting convened to conduct an election in compliance with the judgment in W.A. No . 1869/2016 would be reduced into a mockery in the circumstances .
