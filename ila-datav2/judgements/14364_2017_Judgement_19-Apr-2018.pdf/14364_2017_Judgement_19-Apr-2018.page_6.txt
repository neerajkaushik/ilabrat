6 This is one way of entrusting the management of a Co - operative Bank to an Administrator under the Kerala Co - operative Societies Act in the guise of an election . We are also of the prima facie opinion that the Government Order dated 15/10/2016 granting exemption under Section 101 of the Act does not apply to this Co - operative Bank . 4 . We are not for a moment holding that all these 611 members found in the preliminary voters list are eligible to vote as the same is open to question in an election dispute , whether a register in Form 32 on the basis of which the list of 611 members has been Prepared has to be gone into under Section 69 of the Kerala Co - operative Societies Act . Similarly the infraction if any of Section 16A and 19A of the Kerala Co - operative Societies Act are also matters to _ be adjudicated as and when a statutory dispute is raised . The cut - off date for implementation of the amended provision of Rule 18A of the Kerala Co - operative Societies Rules has been clarified to be 26/11/2016 in SLP No . 27046/2016 . The judgment in Pradeep U.R. and Another v. Kerala State Co - operative Election Commission and Others 2016 ( 4 ) KHC 93 ( FB ) stands modified as above . The implementation of the amended provisions of the Kerala Co - operative Societies Act and the Rules does not therefore depend on the birth of a ' Co - operative year ' .
