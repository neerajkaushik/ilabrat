13 court . No such delegation or conferment can ever be conceived . ‚Äù 13 . It has also to be noted that while passing the interim order dated 01.11.2016 , the High Court had specifically noted that the same was subject to the writ petitions and also Section 69 of the Act . 14 . In the above circumstances , we are of the view that the matters need to be considered afresh by the High Court since the Court could not have relegated the parties to the alternative remedy under the Statute by enlarging the time for preferring the election dispute . Accordingly , the impugned Judgment to that extent is set aside . The writ petitions are remitted to the High Court for fresh consideration . It will be open to the parties to raise all available contentions before the High Court . We request the High Court to dispose of the writ petitions expeditiously . 15 . We make it clear that till the writ petitions are disposed of by the High Court , the interim arrangement made by this Court in the Judgment dated 05.12.2016 will continue . These appeals are disposed of as above .
