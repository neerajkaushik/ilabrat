25 According to him all the offices held by Srivastava after relinquishing the office of the Assistant to the Deputy Commissioner required special knowledge of law and as such whole of that period is liable to be included for counting 10 years during which he held a judicial office . Srivastava , according to him , is qualified for appointment as a judge of a High Court . 32 . We have given our thoughtful consideration to the argument advanced by Mr. Venugopal . We are not inclined to agree with him . ‚Äù 21 . Thus , the observation in Shri Kumar Padma Prasad ( supra ) , in paragraph 35 as extracted above was in the above context . This Court was not concerned with the issue which is raised in the present writ petition as to whether the person should be holding a Judicial Office at the time of his appointment as Additional Judge of the High Court , although , he held a Judicial Office of the State when his name was recommended by the High Court for Additional Judge . Thus , the observations made by this Court in paragraphs 25 , 35 and 41 do not support the contentions which are sought to be raised by the petitioner .
