the appellants could only contend that they have a right to be considered for the post of Lecturer / Assistant Professor . This right is always subject to minimum eligibility conditions , and till such time as the appellants are appointed , different conditions may be laid down = at different times . Merely because an additional eligibility condition in the form of a NET test is laid down , it does not mean that any vested right of the appellants is affected , nor does it mean that the regulation laying down such minimum eligibility condition would be retrospective in operation . Such condition would only be prospective as it would apply only at the stage of appointment . It is clear , therefore , that the contentions of the private appellants before us must fail . 17 . One of the learned counsel for the petitioners argued , based on _ the language of the direction of the Central Government dated 12 - 11 - 2008 that all that the Government wanted UGC to do was to " generally " prescribe NET as a qualification . But this did not mean that UGC had to prescribe this qualification without providing for any exemption . We are unable to accede to this argument for the simple reason that the word " generally " precedes the word " compulsory " and it is clear that the language of the direction has been followed both in letter and in spirit by the UGC regulations of 2009 and 2010 . 14
