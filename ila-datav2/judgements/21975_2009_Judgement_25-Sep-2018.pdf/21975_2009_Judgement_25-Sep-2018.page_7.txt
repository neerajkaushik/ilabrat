complaint itself was misconceived and that in any event , it was incapable of being entertained and eventually being allowed on facts and in law but we were not impressed by her submissions . 16 . Once the three forums , on facts , held against the appellant - Authority ( a finding quoted above ) , then we are not inclined to go into any issue which , even otherwise , does not arise for consideration . 17 . In the light of the foregoing discussion , we find no merit in the appeal , which fails and is accordingly dismissed with costs quantified at Rs.10,000/ payable by the appellant - Authority to the respondents . sdkaite eheee LENE NINES mone EReN TEER J.
