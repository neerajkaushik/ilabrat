Court ’s ordinary appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases is to the extent laid down in Article 134 of the Constitution . Some of the appeals in that article are available as of right and others lie if a special certificate is granted by the High Court . This appeal belongs to neither class . It is not as of right and no special certificate has _ been granted by the High Court . There is in our jurisdiction no “ sacred right of appeal ” as the French Canadian law assumes(See Mayor etc . of Montreal v. Brown , ( 1876 ) 2 AC 168 ( 184 ) . Once a decision is given by the High Court , that is final unless an appeal is allowed by special leave of this Court . No doubt this Court has granted special leave to _ the appellants but the question is one of the principles which this Court will ordinarily follow in such an appeal .

In other words this Court does not form a fresh opinion as _ to the innocence or the quilt of the accused . It accepts the appraisal of the evidence in the High Court and the court or courts below . Therefore , before this Court interferes something more must be shown , such as , that there has been in the trial _ a violation of the principles of natural justice or_a deprivation of the rights of the accused ora _ misreading of vital evidence or an improper reception or rejection of evidence which , if discarded or received , would leave the conviction unsupportable , or that the court or courts have committed an error of law or of the forms of legal process or procedure by which justice itself has failed . We have , in approachin this case borne these principles in mind . They are the _ principles for the exercise of jurisdiction in criminal
