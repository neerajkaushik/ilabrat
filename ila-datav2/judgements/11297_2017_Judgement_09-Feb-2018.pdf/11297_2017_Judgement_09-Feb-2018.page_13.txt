13 paragraph 9 of the impugned judgment claiming compensation of Rs.80,000/- towards the same . The High Court in paragraph 13 of the impugned judgment , however , rejected the claim on the finding that the appellant had failed to invite its attention to any document indicating that the appellant had incurred the expenses of Rs.80,000/- towards car repair . Even in the present appeals , the appellant has failed to invite attention of this Court to any document on record in support of the said claim . Resultantly , we find no reason to interfere with the opinion expressed by the High Court on the issue under consideration . 15 . A priori , the appellant would succeed in getting additional amount of Rs.2,85,966/- ( Rupees two lakh eighty five thousand nine hundred and sixty six only ) as enhanced compensation towards ‘ loss of income ’ and ‘ loss of future income ’ , along with interest at the rate of 9 % ( nine percent ) per annum thereon from the date of filing of the claim petition before the Tribunal till the date of realization .
