The High Court further came to the    conclusion that Enquiry Officer acted himself as prosecutor and Judge in the said disciplinary enquiry . It is useful to extract paragraphs 9 and 10 of the judgment which are to the following effect : ™ ( 9 ) This Court directed the learned Asstt . S.G. appearing for the respondents to make available the proceedings of the disciplinary enquiry against the petitioner . On perusal of the proceeding , it is crystal clear that no Presenting Officer was appointed in the said proceedings and the Enquiry Officer himself led the examination in chief of the prosecution witness by putting questions . This fact is not disputed by the learned Asstt . S.G. appearing for the respondents , but his only submission is that all opportunities were given to the writ petitioner to put up his defence case and also the writ petitioner had pleaded guilty for both the charges levelled against him . ( 10 ) I@ dy therefore , crystal clear that the Enquiry Officer acted himself as Prosecutor and Judge in the said disciplinary enquiry against the writ petitioner . From this admitted fact , it may not be wrong to infer that there were no fair procedures in the disciplinary proceedings as a result of which principle of natural justice was undisputedly denied to the writ petitioner . ”
