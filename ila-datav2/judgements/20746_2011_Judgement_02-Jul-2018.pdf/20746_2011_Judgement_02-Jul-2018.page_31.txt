31 reverses the findings which were in favour of the delinquent employee , the rules of natural justice are    not applicable . This Court held that principle of natural justice has to be read in Regulation 7(2 ) even though rule does not specifically require hearing of delinquent officer . In paragraph 19 following was held : “ 19 . The result of the aforesaid discussion would be that the principles of natural justice have to be read into Regulation 7(2 ) . As a result thereof , whenever the disciplinary authority disagrees with the enquiry authority on any article of charge , then before it records its own findings on such charge , it must record its tentative reasons for such disagreement and give to the delinquent officer an opportunity to represent before it records its findings . The report of the enquiry officer containing its findings will have to be conveyed and the delinquent officer will have an opportunity to persuade the disciplinary authority to accept the favourable conclusion of the enquiry officer . The principles of natural justice , as we have already observed , require the authority which has to take a final decision and can impose a penalty , to give an opportunity to the officer charged of misconduct to file a representation before the disciplinary authority records its findings on the charges framed against the officer . ”
