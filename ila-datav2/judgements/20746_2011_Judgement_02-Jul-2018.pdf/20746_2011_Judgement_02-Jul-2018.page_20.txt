In State of Uttar Pradesh and others vs. Saroj Kumar Sinha , 2010 ( 2 ) SCC 772 , this Court had laid down that inquiry officer is a quasi - judicial authority , he has to act as independent adjudicator and he is not a representative of the department / disciplinary authority / Government . In paragraphs 28 and 30 following has been held : “ 28 . An inquiry officer acting in a quasi - judicial authority is in the position of an independent adjudicator . He is not supposed to be a representative of the department / disciplinary authority/ Government . His function is to examine the evidence presented by the Department , even in the absence of the delinquent official to see as to whether the unrebutted evidence is sufficient to hold that the charges are proved . In the present case the aforesaid procedure has not been observed . Since no oral evidence has been examined the documents have not been proved , and could not have been taken into consideration to conclude that the charges have been proved against the respondents .
