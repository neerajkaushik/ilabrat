We may note that except the statement made under Section 67 of the N.D.P.S. Act by respondent no.1 , there is no other material to substantiate the case against the said respondent . Both PW-8 and PW-9 have categorically stated that , when they were called by the Intelligence Officer ( PW-1 ) and by the time they reached , the bag was already opened . Further it was admitted by them that , the panchanama was not read over to them . They were asked to sign on number of papers and they were not aware of the contents .

The cross - examination of PW-9 clearly reveals that he does not agree to the contents of the panchanama with respect to the fact that the search and inspection of the baggage took place in his presence . His signatures obtained on the panchanama were not voluntarily put , which is apparent from
