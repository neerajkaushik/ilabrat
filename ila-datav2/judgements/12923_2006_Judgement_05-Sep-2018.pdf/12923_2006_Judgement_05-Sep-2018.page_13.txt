13 must be concluded giving strict adherence to the statutory rules framed for the purpose . ” We may usefully refer to two other decisions dealing with the issue under consideration . In Muthu Karuppan , Commissioner of Police , Chennai Vs . Parithi Ilamvazhuthi and Anr . , 2 this Court observed thus : “ 15 . Giving false evidence by filing false affidavit is an evil which must be effectively curbed with a strong hand . Prosecution should be ordered when it is considered expedient in the interest of justice to punish the delinquent , but there must be a prima facie case of ‘ deliberate falsehood ’ on a matter of substance and the court should be satisfied that there is a reasonable foundation for the charge . ” “ 17 . The contempt proceedings being quasi - criminal in nature , burden and standard of proof is the same as required in criminal cases . The charges have to be framed as per the statutory rules framed for the purpose and proved beyond reasonable doubt keeping in mind that the alleged contemnor is entitled to the benefit of doubt . Law does not permit imposing any punishment in contempt proceedings on mere probabilities , equally , the court can not punish the alleged contemnor without any foundation merely on conjectures and surmises . As observed above , the contempt proceeding being quasi - criminal in nature require strict adherence to the procedure prescribed under the rules applicable in such proceedings . ” 2 ( 2011 ) 5 SCC 496
