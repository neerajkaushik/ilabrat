dated 6 December , 2000 . The relevant portion of the said order reads thus : In the instant petition , unauthorized construction was carried out in Sainik Farm which happens to be an unauthorized colony . It is not disputed that the petitioner started construction on Plot No.37C measuring 834 Sq . Yds . At Ashoka Avenue , Sainki Farm , New Delhi , in July 2000 . The building was allowed to come up and when it was nearing completion the same was demolished on 30.10.2000 . We fail to understand as to how the building activity could be permitted / allowed from July 2000 till October 2000 when order of this court dated November 3 , 1997 was in force . It prima facie appears to us that the building in question could not have come up unless the concerned officers of the MCD and the Police connived with the petitioner . The allegation of the petitioner is that he paid bribes to various offices for raising the construction . He has named those officers . In the circumstances , we consider it appropriate to issue notices to the following officers of the MCD and the Police , who were posted during the time the construction was raised on the plot in question , to show cause why proceedings for contempt of court be not initiated against them : 1 . Mr. R.S. Sherawat ( JE ) MCD 2 . Mr. U.S. Chowhan ( JE ) MCD . Mr. S.R. Bhardwaj , A.E. South zone Building Department MCD . Mr. Puran Singh Rawat , Baildar , MCD Mr. Rakesh Baildar , MCD Mr. Man Mohan , S.I. Chowki Incharge , Sainik Farms Mr. V.K. Malhotra , Ex . Engineer MCD Mr. Vir Singh , SHO . wo ONG The aforesaid officers are present and they accept notice . They are granted two weeks time to file affidavits in reply to the show cause notice .
