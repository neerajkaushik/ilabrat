12 there was no apparent injury on the dead body at the time of panchanama . PW7—Ram Niwas Pandey , who filled the panchanama ( Ext . P2 ) and got the signatures of panch witnesses , also stated that no noticeable injury was found on the body of the deceased and it was the collective opinion of the panch witnesses that the deceased expired due to eating some poisonous substance and he also concurred with them . 16 . In the above backdrop of the case , primarily when there existed a complaint lodged by the wife of deceased pointing out that the deceased committed suicide by consuming poison , generally it is expected that the Doctor will preserve viscera for chemical analysis . On this point , prosecution has failed in its duty as no steps have been taken to preserve viscera . Merely a statement by Doctor — PW 6 that viscera was not preserved as there is no presence of poison would not be suffice in the peculiar circumstances of this case , particularly when the independent panch witnesses together as well as the Investigating Officer recorded their view that it was a case of poisoning , which has been duly supported by PWs 1 , 2 and 3 .
