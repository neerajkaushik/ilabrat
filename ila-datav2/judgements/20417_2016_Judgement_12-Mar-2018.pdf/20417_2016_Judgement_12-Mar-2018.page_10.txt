10 Court mainly relied upon the evidence of the brother of the deceased ( PWS ) and the opinion of the Doctor ( PW 6—Dr . Ashok Kumar Gupta ) who conducted postmortem . According to PW5 when he reached the house of accused at 10 am , they started crying and confessed to him that they had committed the mistake of strangulating his brother as he was adamant to take his wife back . He further deposed that the accused pleaded him not to lodge police complaint and even after lodging FIR they requested him to withdraw . As there was no mention of this circumstance in the FIR , the trial Court disbelieved the version of PWS as regards to extra judicial confession of accused , yet observed that panchanama was prepared prior to any member of the deceased ’s family made a visit to the place of occurrence and none of his family members were present at the time of panchanama . It is important to note that PWS in his cross examination admitted that he was present at the time of preparation of panchanama and when the body was sent for postmortem . As regards to the occurrence , he stated that he had no personal knowledge but only on hearsay basis , he came to know about the occurrence .
