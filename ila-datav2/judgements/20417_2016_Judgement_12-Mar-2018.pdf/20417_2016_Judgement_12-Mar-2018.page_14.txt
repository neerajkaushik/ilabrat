14 are possible basing on the evidence adduced in the case , one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to the innocence of accused , the view which is favourable to the accused should normally be adopted . As we have already observed in the case on hand there is no direct evidence as to the deceased consuming poison or having been done to death by throttling . The presence of blisters all over the body of the deceased and his nails turning into bluish colour , no mark of fingers on the body of the deceased as noted in the postmortem report and the presence of PW5 at the time of panchanama without any objection , non - examination of Dr. Hiralal , the corroborative statements by most of the prosecution witnesses and that of the I.O. to whom Dr. Hiralal also disclosed that the deceased consumed poison , all these circumstances form ample evidence to strengthen the case of the accused that the deceased committed suicide . We are therefore constrained to observe that the Courts below must have persuaded themselves to give the benefit of doubt to the appellant , as in the peculiar circumstances of this case , it is not safe to convict the accused under Section 302 IPC .
