that Dr. Hiralal in his statement disclosed as the deceased saying to him that he was fed up with his life and therefore he had taken sulfas tablets . He ( PW8 ) has specifically revealed that at the time of panchanama there was no apparent injury on the dead body . It would be relevant to extract the wife ’s complaint , which reads as under : “ It is respectfully submitted that the applicant Santosh Devi , wife of Brij Bhushan Tiwari is the resident of Hindupur , P.S. Karchhana . My husband came to my father ’s house about 3/4 days back and was living here comfortably . Yesterday , at about 10 am , he after taking food went out for stroll . When he came back about 6 o’clock to my father ’s house he was walking unsteadily and was wobbling and falling . So in these circumstances , the applicant , her mother and other residents of the village somehow managed to bring him to the clinic of Hiralal . There Shri Brij Bhushan Tiwari himself told the Doctor that I have taken many tablets of sulfas and I do n’t want to live anymore and do n’t make any attempt to save my life . Thereafter , while we were taking him to the Allahabad Hospital , then he expired on the way . It is therefore the applicant is informing you to take appropriate action . ”
