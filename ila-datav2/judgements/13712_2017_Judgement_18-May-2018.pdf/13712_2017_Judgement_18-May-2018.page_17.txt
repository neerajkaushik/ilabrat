all events concerning an enquiry . If the Officer has not recorded , then it is for the trial court to weigh the effect of the same for reasons provided therein . A court under a writ jurisdiction or under the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court is ill equipped to answer such questions of facts . The treatment provided by the High Court in converting a mixed question of law and fact concerning the merits of the case , into a pure question of law may not be proper in light of settled jurisprudence . 19 . Our conclusion herein is strengthened by the fact that CrPC itself has differentiated between irregularity and illegality . The obligation of maintenance of General Diary is part of course of conduct of the concerned officer , which may not itself have any bearing on the criminal trial unless some grave prejudice going to the root of matter is shown to exist at the time of the trial . ! Conspicuous absence of any provision under CrPC concerning the omissions and errors during investigation also bolsters the conclusion reached herein . ‚Äù 1 Union of India and Ors . v. T.
