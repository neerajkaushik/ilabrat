Moreover , the requirement of the preliminary enquiry is well established by judicial precedents as a check on mushrooming false prosecution against public servants by persons who misuse the process of law for their personal vengeance . Such preliminary check would be beneficial and has been continuously approved by catena of judgments of this Court . [ refer to P. Sirajuddin Case , ( 1970 ) 1 SCC 595 , Lalitha Kumari Case ( Supra ) ] . In light of the discussion , we can not sustain the reasoning provided by the High Court on this aspect .

Before we part it may be noted that we have not expressed any views on merits of the case and the trial court is to proceed expeditiously uninfluenced by any observations made herein . ( S.
