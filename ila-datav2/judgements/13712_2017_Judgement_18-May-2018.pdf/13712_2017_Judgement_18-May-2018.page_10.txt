Chhattisgarh that recording of the first information under Section 154 in the “ book ” is subsequent to the entry in the General Diary , held that the concept of General Diary does not flow from the Section 154 of CrPC , 1973 and the same conclusion would be apparent from the departure made in the present Section 154 of CrPC when compared with Section 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1861 . It may be relevant to extract some paragraphs , which may have bearing on the case concerned 64 . The General Diary is a record of all important transactions / events taking place in a police station , including departure and arrival of police staff , handing over or taking over of charge , arrest of a person , details of law and order duties , visit of senior officers , etc . It is in this context that gist or substance of each FIR being registered in the police station is also mentioned in the General Diary since registration of FIR also happens to be a very important event in the police station . Since General Diary is a record that is maintained chronologically on day - to - day basis ( on each day , starting with new number 1 ) , the General Diary entry reference is also mentioned simultaneously in the FIR book , while FIR number is mentioned in the General Diary entry since both of these are prepared simultaneously . 10
