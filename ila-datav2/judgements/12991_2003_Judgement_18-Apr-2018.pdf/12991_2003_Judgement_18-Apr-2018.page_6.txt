proceed under the Act . Instead , as far as OS No . 991 of 1987 is concerned , after the dismissal of the suit for non - prosecution , the appellants preferred an application for restoration which was dismissed as also perhaps a revision petition . At least at that point of time , wisdom should have dawned upon the appellants that the civil court had no jurisdiction in the matter but quite to the contrary , they proceeded with the litigation and later instituted some more proceedings in the civil court . 14 . It is quite clear to us that whatever be the position in law , the appellants invited trouble either by pursuing the litigation in the wrong forum or by not approaching the right forum . For this , the appellants have only themselves to blame and can not hide behind the veil of a lack of jurisdiction of the civil court . 15 . That apart , the appellants were given a full - fledged hearing by the Special Court under the Act in which the following issues were framed : 1 . Whether the petitioners are the owners of the petition schedule property ? 2 . Whether the respondents are not land grabbers within the meaning of Act No . 12 of 1982 3 . To what relief . Additional issue framed on 12.09.1994    Whether the judgments operate as res judicata and whether the applicants are estopped from contending that they are the owners of the schedule property by virtue of the said judgments ?
