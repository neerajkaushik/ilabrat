16 . The Special Court dealt with all these issues and concluded that the appellants had failed to establish that they are the owners of the schedule property and there was no material to establish their ownership . It was also held that the appellants had not been able to show that the respondents had trespassed on the suit property without legal entitlement and were therefore land grabbers within the meaning of the Act . 17 . What is more serious is that the Special Court concluded that there is no certainty about the land alleged to have been grabbed by the respondents . The location of the land was not clear , the area was not clearly identified , the description of the land was very vague , no measurements of the land were given and the boundaries of the land were also not clear . 18 . In this regard , our attention was drawn by learned counsel for the respondents to the description of the land allegedly grabbed by the respondents as stated in the plaint filed before the Special Court .
