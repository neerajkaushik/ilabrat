139 square yards of the land in question and not 500 square yards . This is quite apart from the fact that if the contention of the appellants is that the suits instituted after 1982 are not maintainable , then even the report of the Local Commissioner is without jurisdiction . 20 . In view of the above , we have no hesitation in concluding that the Special Court was fully justified in dismissing the land grabbing case filed by the appellants and the High Court was also justified in dismissing the writ petition filed by them . We find absolutely no reason to interfere with the views expressed and accordingly we dismiss the appeal with costs of Rs . 50,000/- on the appellants for taking several courts for a ride through continuous and fruitless litigation spanning several decades .
