Learned counsel for the appellants sought to rely upon a report given by the Local Commissioner appointed by the civil court in O.S No.1095 of 1993 . The report of the Local Commissioner is dated 17 " October , 1993 and was marked as Exhibit A-42 . The report indicates that the respondents are in possession of 607 square yards which is about 5 guntas and the appellants are in possession of 3025 square yards which is about 25 guntas . Essentially , the report of the Local Commissioner does not show anything more than this . We also find that this report was exhibited in Suit No.1095 of 1993 but it was not proved in evidence before the Special Court or even in Suit No.1095 of 1993 . The Local Commissioner was not examined with regard to the correctness or otherwise of the report . We also find that exhibit A-42 pertains only to C.A. No . 5645 of 2006 Page 8 of 9
