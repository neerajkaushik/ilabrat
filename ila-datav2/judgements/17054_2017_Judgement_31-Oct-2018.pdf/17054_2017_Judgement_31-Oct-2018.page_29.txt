29 as per sub - Rule ( 2 ) of Rule 5 the land would have been disposed of except as otherwise provided in sub - Rule ( 1 ) only by holding public auction ; inviting tenders by public advertisement ; making offers to or accepting offers from any Government , Local Authority , Public Sector Undertaking or a body corporate which is owned or controlled by Government ; inviting applications from persons or bodies of persons who are eligible for allotment of plots under Rule 4 , by public advertisement and land for public amenities such as for primary school , vehicle stand , public latrine or urinal , public library , reading room , hospital , dispensary or such other purpose , etc . Plaintiff 's claim is not covered in any manner of disposal under Rule 5(2 ) , hence no decree would have been passed by the trial court contrary to the statutory Rules as envisaged by Rule 5(2 ) . The view of the High Court that Rules , 1983 are prospective and shall not effect the allotment made in favour of the plaintiff on 06.10.1975 and 16.10.1975 was erroneous . As observed above the allotments which were finalised in pursuance of Resolution dated 06.10.1975 and 16.10.1975
