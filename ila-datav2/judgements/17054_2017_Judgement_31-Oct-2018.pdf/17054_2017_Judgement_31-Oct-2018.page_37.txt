37 27 . No error was committed by the Appellate Court in entering into the issue as to whether application was barred by time . The Appellate Court was well within its jurisdiction in considering the question of limitation . We , however , for the present case need not express any opinion with regard to the question of limitation in view of we having held that plaintiff was not entitled for the decree . Thus , even without entering into the question of limitation we are of the clear opinion that plaintiff was not entitled for the decree as has been granted by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court . 28 . In the result , the appeal is allowed , the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the suit of the plaintiff stands dismissed . ( ASHOK BHUSHAN ) NEW DELHI , OCTOBER 31 , 2018 .
