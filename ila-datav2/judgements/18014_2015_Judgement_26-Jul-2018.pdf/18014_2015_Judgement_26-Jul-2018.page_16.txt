It took note of certain principles that when a person trades or manufactures one good under the broad classification having no bona fide intention to trade in all other goods falling under that broad classification , he can not be permitted to enjoy monopoly in articles falling under such classification as held in Vishnudas Trading as Vishnudas Kushandas ? . Therefore , in the instant case , when the respondent has its limited business only in milk and milk products with no intention to expand the business of trading in other goods falling under Class 29 and the appellant was given registration in other articles only , specifically excluding milk and milk products , there was nothing wrong in according registration of those products in favour of the appellant under the trade mark ‘ NANDHINI ’ . The IPAB also observed that the respondent had failed to prove that by allowing such registration in favour of the appellant , any confusion or deception would ensue . On that reasoning , appeal of the respondent was dismissed . At the same time , the appellant was asked to file a request on Form 16 to delete the goods ‘ milk and milk products ’ The appellant filed the affidavit to this effect , as directed by IPAB on 18 " July , 2011 .
