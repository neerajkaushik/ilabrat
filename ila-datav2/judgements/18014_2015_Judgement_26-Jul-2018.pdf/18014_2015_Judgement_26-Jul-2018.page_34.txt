( a ) The question of the Court / Registrar taking into consideration the provisions of Section 12 of the Act , which provides for registration in the case of honest and concurrent user does not arise as the very basis for the application of this Section is the “ honesty of the concurrent use . ” The appellant was wellaware of the widespread use of the mark Nandhini by the respondent and has admitted that they were purchasing Nandhini milk for their restaurant . Therefore , the appellant can not claim to be an honest or concurrent user , as such claims would be contrary to the evidence placed on record and their own admissions . ( b ) Section 12 of the Act relates to identical or similar goods or services . The appellant is not in the business of selling milk or milk products and the claim made by it is with regard to the trading style for their restaurants ’ name “ NANDHINI ” . Therefore , the goods or services of the appellant are neither identical , nor similar , to those of the the respondent . ( c ) At any rate , Section 11(2 ) being couched in negative language indicates that it is mandatory nature and would override the provisions of Section 12 .
