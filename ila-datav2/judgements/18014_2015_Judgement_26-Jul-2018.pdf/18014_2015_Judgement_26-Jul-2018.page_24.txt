and similar marks Halsbury has stated at pp . 543 - 44 , Vol . 38 , thus : “ Subject to the effect of honest concurrent use or other special circumstances , no trade mark may be registered in respect of any goods or description of goods that ( 1 ) is identical with a trade mark belonging to a different proprietor and already registered in respect of the same goods or description of goods ; or ( 2 ) so nearly resembles such a registered trade mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion . ” Since the Trade Marks Act , 1940 is based on the English statute and the relevant provisions are of the same nature in both the laws , though the language of Section 8(a ) is slightly different from that of Section 11 of the English Act and that of Section 10(1 ) from that of Section 12(1 ) of the English Act , we see no reason for holding that the provisions of Section 8(a ) would not apply where a mark identical with or resembling that sought to be registered is already on the register . The language of Section 8(a ) is wide and though upon giving full effect to that language the provisions of Section 10(1 ) would , in some respects , overlap those of Section 8(a ) , there can be no justification for not giving full effect to the language used by the legislature . ” ( ii ) He also argued that even if it is assumed that Section 9(2)(a ) is distinct from Section 11(1 ) , insofar as enquiry “ likelihood of confusion and deception ” is concerned , it was supposed to be undertaken by applying well settled factors and variables which are stipulated in a series of judgments .
