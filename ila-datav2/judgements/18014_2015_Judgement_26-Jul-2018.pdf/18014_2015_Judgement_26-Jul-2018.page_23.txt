( c ) London Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Durex Products Incorporated & Anr ’ : “ 8 . The provisions of Sections 8 and 10 of the Act are enabling provisions in the sense that it is not obligatory upon a proprietor of a mark to apply for its registration so as to be able to use it . But when a proprietor of a mark , in order to obtain the benefit of the provisions of the Trade Marks Act , such as a legally protected right to use it , applies for registration of his mark he must satisfy the Registrar that it does not offend against the provisions of Section 8 of the Act . The burden is on him to do so . Confining ourselves to clause ( a ) the question which the Registrar has to decide is , whether having regard to the reputation acquired by use of a mark or a name , the mark at the date of the application for registration if used in a normal and fair manner in connection with any of the goods covered by the proposed registration , will not be reasonably likely to cause deception and _ confusion amongst a substantial number of persons ( See 38 Halsbury 's Laws of England pp . 542 - 43 ) . What he decides is a question of fact but having decided it in favour of the applicant , he has a discretion to register it or not to do so ( Re Hack 's Application [ ( 1940 ) 58 RPC 91 ] ) . But the discretion is judicial and for exercising it against the applicant there must be some positive objection to registration , usually arising out of an illegality inherent in the mark as applied for at the date of application for registration ( Re Arthur Fairest Ltd. Application [ ( 1951 ) 68 RPC 197 ] ) . Deception may result from the fact that there is some misrepresentation therein or because of its resemblance to a mark , whether registered or unregistered , or to a trade name in which a person other than the applicant had rights ( Eno v. Dunn [ ( 1890 ) 15 AC 252 ] ) . Where the deception or confusion arises because of resemblance with a mark which is registered , objection to registration may come under Section 10(1 ) as well ( See note ‘ k ’ at p. 543 of 38 Halsbury ’s Laws of England ) . The provisions in the English Trade Marks Act , 1938 ( 1 & 2 Geo . 6 clause 22 ) which correspond to Sections 8 and 10(1 ) to 10(3 ) of our Act are Sections 11 and 12(1 ) to 12(3 ) .
