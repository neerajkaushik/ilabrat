14 respondent to appear before the High Court on the date fixed and answer the claim or claims made in the petition . ‚Äù 12 . Ona bare perusal of the said Rules , it is evident that the election petition is required to be placed for orders before the Court by the office only after removal of office objections as per Rule 285 . If the office objections are pending and not cured within the prescribed period , the office is obliged to list the matter before the Court for appropriate orders under Rule 284 . For that reason , the High Court opined that in the absence of any positive statement in the application filed by the election petitioner and as the record would show that the matter was placed by the office before the Court under Rule 285 , it must follow that the grievance made in the application under consideration was based on mere conjectures and surmises and can not be the basis to dismiss the election petition at the threshold , as prayed . We respectfully agree with the said view taken by the High Court and as a result , the order rejecting the application under consideration , being Election Application No.2 of 2017 , deserves to be upheld .
