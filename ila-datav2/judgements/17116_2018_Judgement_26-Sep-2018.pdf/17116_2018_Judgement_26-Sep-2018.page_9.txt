9 to be recalled and the election petition dismissed for nonremoval of the office objections within the limitation period . The respondent No.1 , on the other hand , supported the view expressed by the High Court in rejecting the application and has reiterated the same argument before us . 8 . The question is : whether the view taken by the High Court as regards the rejection of Election Application No.2 of 2017 is just and proper ? For that , we may first turn to the averments in the application to discern whether the finding recorded by the High Court is a possible view . The relevant averments can be traced to paragraphs 10 , 11 and 14 in particular . The same read thus : “ 10 . It appears that after the election petition was filed , the office / Registry of this Hon’ble Court has raised several objections which are more popularly referred to and known as ‘ office objections ’ . That in terms of Rule 282 ( ii ) read with Section 283 , the same were bound to be removed by the petitioner or his advocate on the 3 day from the date of presentation provided and stipulated under Rule 282 ( ii ) . The 34 day from the date of filing of the petition would fall on the 20th of August . 11 . It appears that the objections which were raised by the office were not removed and the election petition was placed pursuant to the request made on the 18 of August for circulation on the 21st of August . Thus , in the respectful and humble submission of the Applicant / Respondent No.1 , there is non - compliance of Rules 282 ( ii ) and 283 . ”
