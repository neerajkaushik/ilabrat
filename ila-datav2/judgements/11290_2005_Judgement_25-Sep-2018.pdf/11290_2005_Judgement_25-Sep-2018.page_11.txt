Therefore , according to him , Shyama Sundari Dassi could not have dealt with those properties which were inherited from her husband . These submissions were countered by Mr. Ajay Kumar Gupta , learned Senior Advocate who submitted that very comparison of properties mentioned in respective Schedules to the Wills would show that there were various properties which belonged to Shyama Sundari Dassi in her individual capacity and that she was entitled to dispose of the same by executing a Will . 12 . We must , at the outset , say that the scope of the matter arising from Probate proceedings is very limited . The scope of the matter is primarily and principally regarding the genuineness of the execution of the testament or Will .

Paragraphs 57 , 66 and 67 of the said decision spell out the scope of the enquiry in Probate proceedings as under : 1 ( 2008 ) 4 SCC 300
