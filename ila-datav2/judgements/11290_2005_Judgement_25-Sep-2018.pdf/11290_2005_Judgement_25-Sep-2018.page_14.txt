13 . with the learned counsel that the petitioner has caveatable interest . ” This Court , thus , categorically opined that while granting a probate , the court would not decide any dispute with regard to title . A separate suit would be maintainable therefor . If probate is granted , they have a remedy in terms of Section 263 of the 1925 Act also . 67 . In the recent judgment of Kanwarjit Singh Dhillon v. Hardyal Singh Dhillon ( 2007 ) 11 SCC 357 this Court inter alia relying upon Chiranjilal Shrilal Goenka v. Jasjit Singh ( 1993 ) 2 SCC 507 and upon referring to a catena of decisions of the High Court and this Court , held that the Probate Court does not decide any question of title or of the existence of the property itself . ” ( Emphasis by us ) 14 We , therefore , confine ourselves only to the issue whether the execution of the Will of which Probate is prayed for has been satisfactorily proved and whether there are any suspicious circumstances impinging upon the execution of the Will . Out of four issues , three were answered in favour of the propounders of the Will by the Single Judge wherefrom no appeal was preferred . The matter was thus limited in scope before the Division Bench which , in any case , has answered the other issues also in favour of the propounders of the Will . Having gone through the judgment under appeal , we do not see any reason to take a different view in the matter nor has any ground been made out to upset the decision under appeal .
