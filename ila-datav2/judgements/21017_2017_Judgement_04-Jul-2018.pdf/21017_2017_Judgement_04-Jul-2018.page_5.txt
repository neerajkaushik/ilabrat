head . The Appellant who had examined himself as a witness also stated that he swung the tangi in self - defense when he was being attacked . There is no doubt in our mind that the Accused is responsible for the death of Ram Kumar Sahu . 5 . The case of the Appellant is that he wielded the tangi in self - defense . The tangi came into his hand when he was trying to protect himself from being hit by Krishna Kumar Sahu . There is no dispute that the Appellant is also injured on the head during the incident . He was in the hospital for a period of eight days for treatment . Dr. O.P. Shrivastava ( PW-13 ) examined the Appellant on 11 " November , 2005 and found an incised wound about 2 ” long in the mid part of the head . He also found contusions at the bottom of the left thumb ( about 1 ” x 2 ” ) , on the upper part of pelvic region ( about 6 ” ) and below left the knee ( about 1.5 ” x 0.5 ” ) . He opined that the incised injury could have been caused by the said tangi and the other contusions could have been caused by the seized danda . However , the prosecution failed to explain the injuries caused to the Appellant .
