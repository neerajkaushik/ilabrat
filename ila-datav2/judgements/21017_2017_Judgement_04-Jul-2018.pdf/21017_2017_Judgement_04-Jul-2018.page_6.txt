6 . After considering the material on record , we are of the considered view that the Appellant is not liable for conviction under Section 302 IPC . There is no evidence to show that the murder of Ram Kumar Sahu was a premeditated one . We are convinced that the Appellant did not have any intention to kill Ram Kumar Sahu . However , Appellant swung the tangi which hit Ram Kumar Sahu on his head and due to the said injury Ram Kumar Sahu had died . 7 . In conclusion , the Appellant â€™s conviction under Section 302 IPC is set aside . The Appellant is , however , convicted under Section 304 ( Part II ) IPC and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for a period of seven years . In case , the Appellant has completed the sentence of seven years , he may be released forthwith . 8 . The appeal is , accordingly , disposed of . [ MOHAN M.
