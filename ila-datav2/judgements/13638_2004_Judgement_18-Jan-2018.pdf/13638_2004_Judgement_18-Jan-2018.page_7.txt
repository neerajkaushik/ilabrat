valuable consideration and had also paid the full consideration . After purchasing the same he had leased out the property and was collecting rents . The appellant , therefore , pleaded that sale deed in his favour was valid and sale deed in favour of respondent nos . 1 and 2 by Oubegaranadin was illegal . 12 ) On the basis of pleadings , issues were drawn by the trial court . Parties led their evidence and after hearing the arguments , the trial court passed the judgment and decree dated January 17 , 1986 holding that decree passed in O.S. No . 70 of 1974 was valid since no prejudice had been caused to the interest of the then minors , i.e. , respondent nos . 3 to 5 herein . He also held that three sale deeds executed by respondent nos . 3 to 5 were not under coercion but were executed to meet the family debts and out of necessity . Since , respondent nos . 3 to 5 have been left without any property , the learned Subordinate Judge , opined that an additional 10 % of the sale consideration for the suit property and 5 % of the sale consideration for the land be paid over by the appellant and respondent nos . 1 and 2 to respondent nos . 3 to 5 and on the said basis , quantified the sum to be paid . 13 ) Aggrieved by the partial decree of suit , as full relief prayed for not having been granted , respondent nos . 3 to 5 preferred the appeal ( A.S. No . 1052 of 1986 ) on the file of the High Court of Civil Appeal No . 3227 of 2017 Page 7 of 23
