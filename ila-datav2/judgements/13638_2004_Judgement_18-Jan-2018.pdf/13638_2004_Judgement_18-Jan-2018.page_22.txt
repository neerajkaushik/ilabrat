It is to be borne in mind that the properties in question had fallen in the share of Oubegaranadin on the basis of partition deed dated March 23 , 1959 between Oubegaranadin and his brothers . As on that date , French Code governed the field as per which customary Hindu Law applies . It is not disputed that Oubegaranadin had become the absolute owner of the property in question . Therefore , the moot question is as to whether he could give away portions of these properties to his sons by entering into a partition deed like the one he executed on March 15 , 1971 ?
