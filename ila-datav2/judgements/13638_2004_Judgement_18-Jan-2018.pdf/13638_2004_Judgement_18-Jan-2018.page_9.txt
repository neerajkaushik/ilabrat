High Court . These appeals are allowed by the Division Bench vide impugned judgment dated March 04 , 2004 in the following terms : “ 20 . In view of the foregoing discussion , the judgment and decree allowing the appeal in A.S. No . 1052/86 is set aside . Equally the dismissal of Cross Objection filed by the Appellant regarding the levy of compensation can not be sustained , as the Learned Judge himself found that such a decree for damage by the trial court can not be sustain . Though the appellants have challenged the judgment and decree made in A.S. No . 335/1987 filed by the 10 " defendant , the appellants are not aggrieved persons and hence we are inclined to dismiss the appeal in L.P.A. No . 114/1999 . Accordingly , L.P.A. Nos . 113 and 115 of 1999 are allowed and L.PA . No . 114/1999 is dismissed . No costs . ” 16 ) The High Court has held that by Regulation dated January 06 , 1817 , the French Code was applicable and by Regulation dated April 24 , 1880 , Civil Procedure Code was made applicable to Puducherry . As per the said French Code , customary Hindu Law was applicable . Applying that law , the High Court has concluded that since Oubegaranadin was the absolute owner of the said property , as per Hindu law sons can not seek partition in the property of their father . Therefore , the Partition Deed dated March 15 , 1971 was not a valid instrument and the findings of the Single Judge that Oubegaranadin had lost his right by virtue of partition deed is contrary to law .
