Madras . Respondent nos . 1 and 2 preferred cross - objection insofar as the sale consideration in respect of the land ( it is not the subject matter of the present appeal ) . Insofar as the direction to pay an additional 10 % of the sale consideration for the building to respondent nos . 3 to 5 , the appellant preferred an independent appeal in A.S. No . 335 of 1987 in the High Court of Madras . 14 ) The learned Single Judge of the High Court vide judgment dated March 19 , 1988 reversed the judgment of the Trial Court on certain counts and allowed A.S. Nos . 1052 of 1986 and A.S. No . 335 of 1987 . Holding that respondent nos . 3 to 5 were the absolute owners and Oubergaranadin had no right over the same property , it was concluded that the judgment and decree passed in O.S. No . 70 of 1974 was fraudulent and not binding on respondent nos . 3 to 5 and that respondent nos . 3 to 5 were entitled to be declared owners of the suit property subject to sale deeds executed by them . Though , the learned Single Judge held that in view of the fact that the appeal preferred by respondent nos . 3 to 5 are allowed , respondent nos . 1 and 2 are not liable to pay any compensation and , ultimately , dismissed the cross - objection . 15 ) Aggrieved by the said judgment , respondent nos . 1 and 2 filed LPA Nos . 113 to 115 of 1999 before the Division Bench of the Civil Appeal No . 3227 of 2017 Page 8 of 23
