through respondent no . 6 as his guardian in respect of his 1/3 ‚Äù share in the suit property . 8) From the facts noted uptill now , it gets revealed that in respect of the property which had fallen in the share of Oubegaranadin , partition was effected between him and his sons ( respondent nos . 3 to 5 ) vide Partition Deed dated March 15 , 1971 . However , in the suit for declaration filed by him thereafter , he got the decree vide which the said partition suit was nullified . Thereafter , claiming himself to be the complete and exclusive owner of the property , Oubegaranadin sold part of those properties ( Nos . 76C and 76D , Mahatma Gandhi Road , Puducherry ) to respondent nos . 1 and 2 therein . On the other hand , respondent nos . 3 to 5 , still claiming themselves to be the owner of the properties , on the basis Partition Deed dated March 15 , 1971 , sold their respective portions to the appellant herein . Thus , the appellant as well as respondent nos . 1 and 2 have purchased the same suit property . Which sale is to be recognised is the question . The answer to this now hinges upon the validity of the decree dated June 24 , 1974 vide which the partition deed dated March 15 , 1971 was nullified and Oubegaranadin was declared as the absolute owner of the suit property . However , as would be noticed hereinafter , validity of the Partition Deed dated March 15 , 1971 itself is in Civil Appeal No . 3227 of 2017 Page 4 of 23
