13 the truck driver , the blame must rest on the driver of the maruti car for having driven his vehicle rashly and negligently . The High Court has justly taken note of the fact that the driver and owner of the maruti car , as well as insurer of that vehicle , had not been impleaded as parties to the claim petition . The Tribunal has also taken note of the fact that in all probability , the driver and owner of the maruti car were not made party being close relatives of the appellants . In such a situation , the issue of contributory negligence can not be taken forward . 13 . However , even in such a case , the Tribunal could have been well advised to invoke Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988 , ( for short “ the Act ” ) providing for liability of the owner of the vehicle ( subject truck ) involved in the accident . It is a well settled position that fastening liability under Section 140 of the Act on the owner of the vehicle is regardless of the fact that the subject vehicle was not driven rashly and negligently . We may usefully refer to the decisions in Indra Devi and others Vs . Bagada Ram and another ’ and 1 ( 2010 ) 13 SCC 249
