11 wide . It is unfathomable that on such a narrow road , the subject truck would move at a high speed as alleged . In any case , the maruti car which was following the truck was expected to maintain a safe distance , as envisaged in Regulation 23 of the Rules of the Road Regulations , 1989 , which reads thus : “ 23 . Distance from vehicles in front.- The driver of a motor vehicle moving behind another vehicle shall keep at a sufficient distance from that other vehicle to avoid collision if the vehicle in front should suddenly slow down or stop . ” The expression ‘ sufficient distance ’ has not been defined in the Regulations or elsewhere . The thumb rule of sufficient distance is at least a safe distance of two to three seconds gap in ideal conditions to avert collision and to allow the following driver time to respond . The distance of 10 - 15 feet between the truck and maruti car was certainly not a safe distance for which the driver of the maruti car must take the blame . It must necessarily follow that the finding on the issue under consideration ought to be against the claimants .
