22 . We are , thus , unhesitatingly of the view that the enforcement of an award through its execution can be filed anywhere in the country where such decree can be executed and there is no requirement for obtaining a transfer of the decree from the Court , which would have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings . 23.The effect of the aforesaid is that the view taken by the Madhya Pradesh High Court and the Himachal Pradesh High Court is held to be not good in law while the views of Delhi High Court , Kerala High Court , Madras High Court , Rajasthan High Court , Allahabad High Court , Punjab & Haryana High Court and Karnataka High Court reflect the correct legal position , for the reasons we have recorded aforesaid . 24.The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned order dated 20.3.2014 is set aside restoring the execution application filed by the appellant before the Morena courts . The parties are left to bear their own costs . so marne - weare a areesaiecuesareecaeinerajiesseiaiomeied J. ( J. Chelameswar ) CIVIL APPEAL No.1650 of 2018 Page 20 of 21
