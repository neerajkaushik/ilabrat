Court in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction , having jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject - matter of a suit , and in other cases , a High Court having jurisdiction to hear appeals from decrees of courts subordinate to that High Court ; ] ” 17.The line of reasoning supporting the award to be filed in a so - called court of competent jurisdiction and then to obtain a transfer of the decree is primarily based on the jurisdiction clause found in Section 42 , which reads as under : “ 42 . Jurisdiction . - — Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Part or in any other law for the time being in force , where with respect to an arbitration agreement any application under this Part has been made in a Court , that Court alone shall have jurisdiction over the arbitral proceedings and all subsequent applications arising out of that agreement and the arbitral proceedings shall be made in that Court and in no other Court . ” 18.The aforesaid provision , however , applies with respect to an application being filed in Court under Part I. The jurisdiction is over the arbitral proceedings . The subsequent application arising from that agreement and the arbitral proceedings are to be made in that court alone . However , what has been lost sight of is Section 32 of the said Act , which reads as under : “ 32 . Termination of proceedings . — ( 1 ) The arbitral proceedings shall be terminated by the final arbitral award or by an order of the arbitral tribunal under sub - section ( 2 ) . ( 2 ) The arbitral tribunal shall issue an order for the termination of CIVIL APPEAL No.1650 of 2018 Page 17 of 21
