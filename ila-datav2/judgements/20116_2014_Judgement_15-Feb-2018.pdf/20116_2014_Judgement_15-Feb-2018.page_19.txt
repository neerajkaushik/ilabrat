13 apply to an execution application , which is not an arbitral proceeding and that Section 38 of the Code would apply to a decree passed by the Court , while in the case of an award no court has passed the decree . 21.The Madras High Court in Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. v. Sivakama Sundari & Ors . "referred to Section 46 of the said Code , which spoke of precepts but stopped at that . In the context of the Code , thus , the view adopted is that the decree of a civil court is liable to be executed primarily by the Court , which passes the decree where an execution application has to be filed at the first instance . An award under Section 36 of the said Act , is equated to a decree of the Court for the purposes of execution and only for that purpose . Thus , it was rightly observed that while an award passed by the arbitral tribunal is deemed to be a decree under Section 36 of the said Act , there was no deeming fiction anywhere to hold that the Court within whose jurisdiction the arbitral award was passed should be taken to be the Court , which passed the decree . The said Act actually transcends all territorial barriers . Conclusion : supra CIVIL APPEAL No.1650 of 2018 Page 19 of 21
