34 35 . There are two reasons due to which we are unable to accept the request of the appellant to consider the case of bail of the appellant in present proceeding . Firstly , this Court on two earlier occasions had granted liberty to the appellant to make an application for bail before the trial court , the appellant has not filed any application for bail before the trial court and had insisted on releasing him on acceptance of bond under Section 88 Cr . P.C. Secondly , in the facts of this case , trial court is to first consider the prayer of grant of bail of the appellant . We , thus , are of the view that as and when the appellant files a bail application , the same shall be considered forthwith by trial court taking into consideration his claim of disability and other relevant grounds which are urged or may be urged by the appellant before it .
