there is adequate staff available with the JJBs . Unfortunately , the response was rather poor and we were only told that there is adequate staff available . It must be appreciated that a JJB is virtually in the nature of a court , although it does not conduct a trial , but only conducts an enquiry . Nevertheless , it does need . adequate staff to perform its functions in an efficient manner . The JJB also has several administrative functions and they need due attention so that there is effective coordination between the JJB , the officials of the Observation Home , the police , the juvenile in conflict with law and the parents of that juvenile and lawyers representing the police as well as the juvenile in conflict with law . These administrative duties need attention if the JJB is to function effectively and a casual statement that the JJB has adequate staff , though possibly correct , is neither here nor there considering the requirements of the stake - holders who attend the enquiry before the JJB . 73 . In this context , it must also be mentioned that there is a dire need to have quality legal aid lawyers who can assist juveniles in conflict with law . This is an issue that must be taken up with all earnestness by the State Legal Services Authority . Unless a child is given adequate legal representation , it may impact his or her future , W.P.
