the CWC - this would depend on a case to case basis and only as an Amicus Curiae for the purpose of advising the CWC on a question of law , should the need arise . 78 . We were informed , somewhat unfortunately , that Child Welfare Committees are sometimes treated as ‘ second class bodies ’ and that payment of honorarium is not made to them on a regular basis . In addition , they are compelled to hold their sittings in buildings with very poor infrastructure facilities . This is a sad commentary on the working of the JJ Act for which the full responsibility rests on the shoulders of the concerned State Governments who must remedy the situation . ( iv ) Use of technology 79 . The use of technology , both by the JJBs as well as by the CWCs is extremely important and we are disheartened to note from the affidavits and submissions made by MWCD that there is an acute shortage of computers and peripherals with the JJBs and CWCs . Technology is important not only for the effective functioning of the JJBs and CWCs , but also to deal with issues that would arise from time to time concerning the tracing and tracking of missing children , the rescue of children working in hazardous industries , trafficked children , children who leave the Child Care W.P.
