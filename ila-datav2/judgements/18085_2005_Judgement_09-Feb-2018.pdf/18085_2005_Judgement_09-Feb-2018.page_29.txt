to decide on broad policy matters and indeed in some instances , particularly relating to the SCPCR , vacancies have not been filled up for several months . In fact , the NCPCR was compelled to file a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana High Court for a mandamus to the State Governments of Punjab and Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh to fill up the vacancies of members of the SCPCR . * Unfortunately , at one point of time , even the position of the Chairperson of the NCPCR was lying unfilled for several months , until , on the directions of this Court , the position was eventually filled up . We need hardly say that unless the NCPCR and the SCPCRs are given due importance by the Government of India and the State Governments and vacancies are filled up in time , the enforcement of the rights of children will remain on the back burner and any number of welfare schemes formulated by the Government of India or by the State Governments will remain unimplemented or their implementation will remain sketchy and symbolic . 60 . We hope and trust that those in authority and power in the Government of India and in the State Governments appreciate the * Court on its own motion v. State of Punjab and The National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights ( NCPCR ) v. The State of Haryana and Others , Decided on 9 " April , 2013 and reported as MANU / PH/0599/2013 W.P.
