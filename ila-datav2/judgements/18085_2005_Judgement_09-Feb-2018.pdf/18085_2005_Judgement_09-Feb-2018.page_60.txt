A very positive step has been taken in this regard by NALSA and we expect the NCPCR with the assistance of the SCPCRs to carry forward this initiative so that there is meaningful implementation of the JJ Act . 16 . Since the involvement of the State Governments and the Union Territories is critical to child rights and the effective implementation of the JJ Act , it would be appropriate if each High Court and the Juvenile Justice Committee of each High Court continues its proactive role in the welfare of children in their State . To make the involvement and process more meaningful , we request the Chief Justice of every High Court to register proceedings on its own motion for the effective implementation of the Juvenile Justice ( Care and Protection of Children ) Act , 2015 so that road - blocks if any , encountered by statutory authorities and the Juvenile Justice Committee of the High Court are meaningfully addressed after hearing the concerned governmental authorities . A copy of this judgment and order should be sent by the Secretary General of this Court to the Registrar General of each High Court for being placed before the Chief Justice of W.P.
