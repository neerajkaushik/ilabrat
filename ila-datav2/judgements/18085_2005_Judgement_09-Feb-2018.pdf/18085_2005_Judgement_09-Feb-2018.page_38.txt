more so if the child in conflict with law is found guilty and placed in a Special Home . On its part , NALSA has brought out a manual for training of legal aid lawyers and we believe that it will be extremely useful not only for legal aid lawyers who are representing juveniles in conflict with law , but also for legal aid lawyers generally . Similarly , prosecutors also need to be sensitized and we hope that the State Governments will take necessary steps to educate and train them keeping in mind the primary objective of the JJ Act , which is to reintegrate a juvenile in conflict with law in society and to rehabilitate that juvenile . 74 . Inthe context of conducting an effective enquiry , the role of a Probation Officer can not be underestimated nor can we underestimate the significance of an accurate Social Investigation Report prepared by a Probation Officer . The duties of a Probation Officer have been detailed in Rule 64 of the Model Rules and this reads as follows : “ 64 . Duties of a Probation Officer . — ( 1 ) On receipt of information from the Police or Child Welfare Police Officer under clause ( ii ) of sub - section ( 1 ) of section 13 of the Act , without waiting for any formal order from the Board , the Probation Officer shall inquire into the circumstances of the child as may have bearing on the inquiry by the Board and submit a social investigation report in Form 6 to the Board .
