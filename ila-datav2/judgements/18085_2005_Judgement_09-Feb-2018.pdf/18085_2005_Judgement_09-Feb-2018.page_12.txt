Sheela Barse II v. Union of India * which also dealt with abandoned or destitute children lodged in various jails across the country for “ safe custody ” . It was noted in that decision that the National Policy for the Welfare of Children contained the following preamble : “ The nation ’s children are a supremely important asset . Their nurture and solicitude are our responsibility . Children ’s programmes should find a prominent part in our national plans for the development of human resources , so that our children grow up to become robust citizens , physically fit , mentally alert and morally healthy , endowed with the skill and motivations needed by society . Equal opportunities for development of all children during the period of growth should be our aim , for this would serve our large purpose of reducing inequality and ensuring social justice ” . 23 . The Court noted in that decision that if a child is a national asset ( as per the National Policy ) , it is the duty of the State to look after the child with a view to ensuring full development of the personality and that is why statutes dealing with children provide that a child shall not be kept in jail . It was directed that on no occasion should children be kept in jail and if a State Government does not have sufficient accommodation in its remand homes or observation homes for children , they should be released on bail instead of being subjected to incarceration in jail . > ( 1986 ) 3 SCC 632 W.P.
