The matching of the mud recovered from the spot of recovery of the victim â€™s body with the mud stains on the pants of the appellant is also highly incriminating , as rightly held by the Trial Court and the High Court . As regards the scratch marks found on the face and neck of the accused , we have considered the argument of the appellant that it was possible for the injuries to have been inflicted during the scuffle that would have ensued at the time that the party of villagers apprehended the appellant , even though the medical evidence given by PW13 also shows that they could have been inflicted by a woman resisting sexual assault . It is the defence of the appellant that 10 to 15 villagers who went to the Paradhi settlement in search of the accused wearing a red T - shirt must have caught hold of the accused and assaulted him mercilessly , consequent to which the accused sustained scratch marks on his body . Such explanation on behalf of the accused can not be accepted , inasmuch as a total of 8 injuries have been sustained by the accused , out of which 7 are scratch marks and only lisa contusion . If really the accused was assaulted mercilessly by 10 to 15 villagers , at least 10 to 15 contusions or abrasions etc . 14
