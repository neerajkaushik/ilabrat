of the appellant has not been detected in the vaginal swabs of the deceased ( as per the FSL Report being Exh . 38 ) , having been found only on the knickers of the appellant himself ( as per the FSL Report being Exh . 61 ) . However , this , too , can not be a ground to exonerate the appellant , given the totality of circumstances of the case , and also considering that the swabs were mixed with mud , as stated by the doctor PW13 . Additionally , in light of the incriminating circumstances enumerated above , we find ourselves unable to agree with the contention of the learned Senior counsel for the appellant that the non - investigation into the ownership of the second wristwatch recovered vitiates the case against the accused . Moreover , as noted by the High Court , the non - seizure of the sandal of the victim and the stone used to hide the victim â€™s clothes , also does not strike at the root of the matter . 9 . Thus , we are of the opinion that each link in the chain of circumstantial evidence has been adequately established by the prosecution , and the conviction of the appellant is affirmed . 16
