Section 267 of the Companies Act , we see no reason why we should give a narrow meaning to Section 389(1 ) of the Code to debar the court from granting an order to that effect in a fit case . The appeal under Section 374 is essentially against the order of conviction because the order of sentence is merely consequential thereto ; albeit even the order of sentence can be independently challenged if it is harsh and disproportionate to the established guilt . Therefore , when an appeal is preferred under Section 374 of the Code the appeal is against both the conviction and sentence and therefore , we see no reason to place a narrow interpretation on Section 389(1 ) of the Code not to extend it to an order of conviction , although that issue in the instant case recedes to the background because High Courts can exercise inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code if the power was not to be found in Section 389(1 ) of the Code . ” 11 . In Navjot Singh Sidhu v State of Punjab ® a Bench of two learned judges of this Court held that a stay of the order of conviction by an appellate court is an exception , to be resorted to in a rare case , after the attention of the appellate court is drawn to the consequences which may ensue if the conviction is not stayed . The court held : “ The legal position is , therefore , clear that an appellate Court can suspend or grant stay of order of conviction . But the person seeking stay of conviction should specifically draw the attention of the appellate Court to the consequences that may arise if the conviction is not stayed . Unless the attention of the Court is drawn to the specific consequences that would follow on account of the conviction , the person convicted can not obtain an order of stay of conviction . Further , grant of stay of conviction can be resorted to in rare cases depending upon the special facts of the case . ” ® AIR 2007 SC 1003
