section ( 3 ) of Section 8 of the Act as he had been convicted for an offence punishable under Sections 366 and 376 of the Penal Code and it was held by the three - Judge Bench that as the High Court for special reasons had passed an order staying the conviction , the disqualification arising out of the conviction ceased to operate after the stay of conviction . Therefore , the disqualification under sub - sections ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) or ( 3 ) of Section 8 of the Act will not operate from the date of order of stay of conviction passed by the appellate court under Section 389 of the Code or the High Court under Section 482 of the Code . ‚Äù " " 14 These decisions have settled the position on the effect of an order of an appellate court staying a conviction pending the appeal . Upon the stay of a conviction under Section 389 of the Cr . P.C. , the disqualification under Section 8 will not operate . The decisions in Ravi Kant Patil and Lily Thomas conclude the issue . Since the decision in Rama Narang , it has been well - settled that the appellate court has the power , in an appropriate case , to stay the conviction under Section 389 besides suspending the sentence . The power to stay a conviction is by way of an exception . Before it is exercised , the appellate court must be made aware of the consequence which will ensue if the conviction were not to be stayed . Once the conviction has been stayed by the appellate court , the disqualification under sub - sections 1 , 2 and 3 of Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act 1951 will not operate . Under Article 102(1)(e ) and Article 191(1)(e ) , the disqualification operates by or under any law made by Parliament . Disqualification under the above provisions of Section 8 follows upon a conviction for one of the listed offences . 11 I d at page 673
