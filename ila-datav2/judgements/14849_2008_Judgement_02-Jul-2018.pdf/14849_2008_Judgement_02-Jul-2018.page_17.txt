17 Government came with the clarification only on 03.08.2005 shall neither be equitable nor shall stand the test of equality before the law . 24 . When the denial as noted above did not pass the twin test of valid classification and was unconstitutional to deny the said benefit on the premise that Government corrected its error only on 03.08.2005 , hence , with effect from 03.08.2005 only the benefit should be given does not appeal to reason . 25 . In view of foregoing discussions , we do not find any ground to interfere with the judgment of the High Court . In the result , the appeal is dismissed . ( ASHOK BHUSHAN ) NEW DELHI , JULY 02 , 2018
