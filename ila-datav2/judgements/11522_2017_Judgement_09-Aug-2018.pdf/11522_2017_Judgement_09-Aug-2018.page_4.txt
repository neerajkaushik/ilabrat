The learned Trial Court dismissed the claim of the landlord on the ground that no documentary evidence with regard to the enhancement of property tax was forthcoming and as the respondent - tenant had been depositing the monthly rent payable with the Rent Controller , the tenant can not be deemed to be the defaulter . 7 . In appeal , the High Court upheld the order of the learned Trial Court though on a different reasoning . The High Court held that even if the municipal taxes are to be held to be part of the rent payable , there is no automatic enhancement of the rent by an unilateral notice on the part of the landlord under Section 20 of the 1997 Act and that such enhancement has to be ordered by the Rent Controller . As the aforesaid requirement was not met , the High Court dismissed the appeal filed by the landlord . 8 . In the present case , under the tenancy agreement municipal taxes were included in the monthly rent payable and any enhancement thereof
