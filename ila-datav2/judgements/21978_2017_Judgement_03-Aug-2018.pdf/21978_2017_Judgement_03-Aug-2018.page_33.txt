judgments of this Court in Municipal Committee , Bhatinda v. Land Acquisition Collector and others ( 1993 ) 3 SCC 24 , U.P. State Sugar Corporation Ltd. v. State of U.P. and others ( 1995 ) Supp 3 SCC 538 , State of Maharashtra _ and _ another _ v. Umashankar Rajabhau_and _ others ( 1996 ) 1 SCC 299 and State of T.N. and others v. L. Krishnan and others ( 1996 ) 7 SCC 450 .      43 . A noting recorded in the file is merely a noting simpliciter and nothing more . It merely represents expression of opinion by the particular individual . By no stretch of imagination , such noting can be treated as a decision of the Government . Even if the competent authority records its opinion in the file on the merits of the matter under consideration , the same can not be termed as a decision of the Government unless it is sanctified and acted upon by issuing an order in accordance with Articles 77(1 ) and ( 2 ) or Articles 166(1 ) and ( 2 ) . The noting in the file or even a decision gets culminated into an order affecting right of the parties only when it is expressed in the name of the President or the Governor , as the case may be , and authenticated in the manner provided in Article 77(2 ) or Article 166(2 ) . A noting or even a decision recorded in the file can always be reviewed / reversed / overruled or overturned and the court can not take cognizance of the earlier noting or decision for exercise of the power of judicial review . ‚Äù 33
