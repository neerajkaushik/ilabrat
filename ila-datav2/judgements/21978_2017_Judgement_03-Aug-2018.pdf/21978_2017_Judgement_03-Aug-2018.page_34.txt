54 ) In the light of the foregoing discussion , we are of the considered opinion that the then Revenue Minister , who passed the order dated 10.06.2004 had no power to deal with the matter relating to release of the land in question . He simply usurped the power under Section 48 of the Act , which he never possessed . It was an abuse of exercise of power by him while dealing with the State 's largesse . 55 ) That apart , in our view , the filing of the writ petition by the landowners itself was an abuse of judicial process . It was for the simple reason that the earlier litigation , which travelled up to this Court thrice having ended against the landowners , it was binding on the parties . It prevented the landowners to again raise the same issue . 34
