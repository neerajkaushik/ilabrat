down by this Court in Balwant Narayan Bhagde vs. M.D. Bhagwat & Ors . ( 1976 ) 1 SCC 700 , the provisions of Section 48 of the Act had no application to the facts of the case at hand and neither the then Revenue Minister nor the State had any power to invoke the provisions of Section 48 of the Act to release any part of the land on or after 30.05.2000 . 26 ) In the fourth place , learned counsel contended that the then Revenue Minister , who passed the order dated 10.06.2004 had no power to entertain any such application because admittedly during the relevant time , due to announcement of date of the State Assembly elections ( September 2004 ) , the Code of Conduct had come in force which did not permit any Minister to exercise such power . 16
