11 mandatory policy of the government , which is what would happen were a mandamus to be issued on the prayers made . Perspective of individuals may vary , but if the elected bodies which have policy formulation powers , is to be superceded by the ideals of each individual , the situation would be chaotic . The policies formulated and the legislations made , unless they fall foul of the Constitution of India , can not be interfered with , at the behest of the appellants . The appellants have completely missed this point . 14 . We are unequivocally of the view that the High Court has already examined , in detail , the issues that were raised in the present //s , and has issued whatever directions were feasible , keeping in mind the enormity of the problem . Nothing more is required . 15 . We , thus , dismiss the appeal leaving it open to the parties to bear their own costs . lecstetittisssissessseeeC)l [ RANJAN GOGOI ] | [ SANJAY KISHAN KAUL ] ecseseseetsteseevesseees eigen NEW DELHI .
