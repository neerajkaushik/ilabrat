The inter - linked prayers were for constituting an expert body of social activists , architects , lawyers , bureaucrats etc . to review the TDR policy and to lay down parameters to restrict the discretionary powers given to the Municipal Commissioner , of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( hereinafter referred to as ‘ BMC ’ ) , under DCR Regulation No.64 , specifically in matters of concessions in open spaces and parking , in consultation with the Committee . 6 . The appellant , through amendments , thereafter expanded the scope of the petition to lay a challenge to the aforesaid regulation , on the ground that it was ultra vires the Constitution of India , and to quash Appendix VIIA & Appendix VII B of DCR insofar as they deal with the use of heritage and slum TDR in the three prohibited zones . There were many impediments in the way of the appellants , for their petition to be entertained . Firstly , the challenge to the DCR had already been rejected by the judgment of the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in Nivara Hakk Suraksha Samiti and Ors v. State of Maharashtra and Ors . , ? dated 16 " April , 1991 . However , it may be stated that a window was provided by the Division Bench of the High Court which observed , in the impugned order , that it was permissible to permit a challenge in case of violation of Part III of the Constitution of India . 1 Writ Petition ( Civil ) No . 963 of 1991
