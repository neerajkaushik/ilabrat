revenue is generated from those wards by relaxing the dimensions of space . ( 3 ) Considering the complaints by the petitioners that the Respondent No . 2 is not acting on the complaints , Respondent No . 2 to set up a mechanism in the form of a Scheme in each ward , within eight weeks from today by designating officers by posts , to whom the citizens can file their complaints . The outer time limit be also fixed for deciding those complaints . The mechanism be put up on the website of Respondent No . 2 .

( 4 ) We have recorded the statement made by the learned Advocate General that the process of new development plan will commence in 2008 . We have however , noted that in respect of the development plan published in the year 1991 , the process had taken a long time . Considering that , Respondent No . 1 to consider initiating steps at the earliest for putting into place the mechanism for starting the process of the new development plan for 2011 . ‚Äù 11 . We have heard the petitioner - in - person and wondered what grievance of his still survives ! We specifically put this question to him also in the context of the fact that the High Court had examined the matter in such great detail . It is also appropriate to emphasise that local problems must be attended to locally . The High Court is a Constitutional Court . The State Court is best equipped to look into local matters , especially where the area development and zoning regulations of the state or the city are in question . The problems and solutions may vary from state to state . It is really not for this Court to sit as an appellate court over these matters , unless some patent illegality is shown , or it is shown that there is any contravention of the constitutional mandate . We find no such case made out , here .
