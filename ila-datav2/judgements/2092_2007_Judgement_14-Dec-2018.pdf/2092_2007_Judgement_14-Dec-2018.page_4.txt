resource and allowing FSI as an incentive , in the form of tenements for sale in the open market , for cross - subsidization of the slum _ rehabilitation tenements , which are to be provided free of cost to the slum - dwellers . The petition arises out of a prayer of the petitioner to effectively review the existing Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay , 1991 ( hereinafter referred to as ‘ DCR ’ ) . Appellant No.1 claims to be an NGO espousing legal issues concerning the State and the Nation , in larger public interest , while the second appellant is the President of the first appellant . A perusal of the pleadings and the impugned judgment shows that the primary question which occasioned the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court to examine the matter was whether the State , on account of financial inability to provide housing to encroachers on public and private lands , residing in structures which came up before 1.1.1995 , could grant TDR to builders to be used in the suburbs of Mumbai , by permitting increase of FSI from 1 to 2 . This was occasioned on account of the protection granted from eviction and the inability of the State to free parks , gardens , footpaths and roads from encroachment for which , in the wisdom of the Government , they chose a cutoff date of 1.1.1995 . The original prayers show that the concern of the petitioner was to stop the grant of TDR in certain specified areas as under : “ ( i ) Between the tracks of the Western Railway and the Swami Vivekanand Road ; ( ii ) Between the tracks of the Western Railway and the Western Express Highway ; ( iii ) Between the tracks of the Central Railway ( Main Line ) and the Lal Bahadur Shastri Road . ”
