There has been growth of slum areas , thereby blocking access to public land . The density of construction was therefore required to be upscaled to meet the pressing needs of the population . One methodology to address the issue , devised by the State , was that of awarding development rights , as defined in Section 2(9A ) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act , 1966 ( hereinafter referred to as the said Act ) , which provides as follows : “ ( QA ) " development right " means right to carry out development or to develop the land or building or both and shall include the transferable development right in the form of right to utilise the Floor Space Index of land utilisable either on the remainder of the land partially reserved for a public purpose or elsewhere , as the final Development Control Regulations in this behalf provide ” A Transferable Development Right ( hereinafter referred to as ‘ TDR ’ ) is therefore a voluntary , incentive - based programme allowing land owners to sell development rights from their land to a developer , or to other interested parties , who can then use these rights to increase the density of development at another designated location . 3 . In order to understand this concept , we would like to further elucidate that the object is to give compensation in a different way , to private landowners who have transferred a portion of their land to the Government as and when the Government has required such private land to build or expand public utilities like grounds , gardens , bus stands , roads , etc .
