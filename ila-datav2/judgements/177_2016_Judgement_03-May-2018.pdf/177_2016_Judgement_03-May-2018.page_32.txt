Civil Court , their all rights in the suit land itself got extinguished on account of efflux of time ( 31 years ) as has been held supra . 81 ) It is for these reasons also , we are of the view that the appellants have no case . 82 ) In our view , therefore , the High Court was right in its reasoning and the conclusion in holding that the original holders ( three PATIL ) having lost all their rights , title and interest in the suit land on the expiry of 12 years from the date of re - grant in their favour ( assuming the re - grant to be valid ) in 1985 and secondly , they again lost their ownership rights due to dismissal of their two suits ( O.S. Nos . 364 and 365 of 2004 ) on 23.11.2004 , neither the original holders ( three PATIL ) and nor the appellants , who claimed through original holders , had any right to claim any interest in the suit land . 32
