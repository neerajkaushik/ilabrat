The mother , two sisters and the Society contested the suit as defendants . 14 ) This suit was , however , decreed on 26.08.1977 by the Principal Civil Judge ( Sr . Division ) in plaintiff 's favour . It was held that the sale made by the mother and two sisters of the plaintiff in favour of the Society is illegal and thus is not binding on the plaintiff to the extent of his 5/8 â„¢ share in the suit land . 15 ) This decree was challenged by the purchaser ( Society ) in the High Court and later in this Court but was not successful . In other words , the Society lost the legal battle throughout up to this Court and resultantly , the decree dated 26.08.1977 passed by the Principal Civil Judge ( Sr . Division ) in plaintiff 's favour became final .
