72 ) Mr. Shekhar Naphade , learned senior counsel then referred the provisions of MHO Act and KVA Act and pointed out the nature of grant and the re - grant of the suit land made in favour of the original holders by the State and how it devolved on the holders etc . 73 ) In our view , this submission need not be dealt with in detail because it has no relevance in the light of our findings recorded above against the appellants . 74 ) In other words , once the rights of the original holders in the suit land stood extinguished , this submission does not survive for consideration on its merits . 75 ) A right in the property once extinguished by operation of law , it can not be revived unless the law itself provides for its revival in a particular situation . Such is not the case here . 29
