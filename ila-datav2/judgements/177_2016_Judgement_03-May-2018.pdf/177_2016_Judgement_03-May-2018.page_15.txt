35 ) At the outset , we observe that so far as the right , title and interest of the appellants in the suit land is concerned , the appellants neither claim and nor do they have a right to claim any right , title and interest in the suit land in their own rights . In other words , the status of the appellants in this litigation are that of the intending purchasers of the suit land from the original holders of the suit land ( three PATIL ) . 36 ) In our view , if the original holders ( three PATIL ) are able to prove their subsisting right , title and interest over the suit land against the plaintiff , the appellants would be able to get the relief in the suit because they are claiming through original holders ( three PATIL ) . But if the original holders ( three PATIL ) are not able to prove their subsisting right , title and interest over the suit land against the plaintiff , then the appellants would also loose the case . 15
