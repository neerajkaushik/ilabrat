24 20 . We find no room whatsoever for any disagreement with the above view taken by this court in Bombay Tyre International Ltd. ( Supra ) . It is    a view consistent with what was held by the Federal Court and the Privy Council in Central Provinces and Berar ( supra),Boddu_Paidanna ( supra ) and Province of Madras ( supra ) and the decisions that followed thereafter including the decision in Voltas Limited ( supra ) and Atic Industries Limited vs. H.H. Dewa , Asstt . Collector of Central Excise    and_ors ® the true purport of which was explained in Bombay Tyre International Ltd. ( Supra ) . Both the above opinions were clarified to mean that neither of them lay down any proposition to the effect that the excise duty can be levied only on the manufacturing cost plus the manufacturing profit only . 21 . At this stage , the amendment to Section 3 by substitution of the words “ a duty of excise on all excisable goods ” by the words “ a duty of excise to be called the Central Value Added Tax ( CENVAT ) on all excisable goods ” is conspicuous . The amendment of Section 3 to the Act not only incorporates the essentials of a changed concept of charging of tax on additions to the value of goods and services at each stage of production but also engrafts in the statute what was judicially held to be permissible additions to the manufacturing cost and manufacturing profit 9 ( 1975 ) 1 SCC 499
