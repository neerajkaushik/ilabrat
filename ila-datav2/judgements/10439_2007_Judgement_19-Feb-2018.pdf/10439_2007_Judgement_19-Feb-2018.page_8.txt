17 . We find that the judgment of the first Appellate Court , which was impugned in the second appeal , was delivered on 13.11.1986 whereas the second appeal was registered in 1992 ( S.A. No.382/92 ) and the impugned judgment was delivered on 13.12.2006 . 18 . The High Court as it seems did not frame any substantial question of law while admitting the appeal as per sub - section(4 ) of Section 100 though it remained pending for a long time . However , the High Court proceeded to allow the second appeal and while doing so framed the substantial question of law in the concluding para of the impugned judgment . It reads as under : “ The substantial question of law would , therefore , be whether the finding of the learned lower appellate court terming the transfer on the basis of a consent decree as a gift in the absence of any pleadings was perverse or not ? The question of law stands answered in the foregoing discussion . In view of this , the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the learned lower appellate court dated 13.11.1986 is set aside . ”
