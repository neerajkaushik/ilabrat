35 . It is , therefore , the duty of the High Court to always keep in mind the law laid down in Santosh Hazari ( supra ) while formulating the question and deciding the second appeal . 36 . In the light of the foregoing discussion , we can not sustain the impugned judgment which , in our view , does not conform to the requirements of Section 100 of the Code and hence calls for interference in this appeal . 37 . The appeals thus deserve to be allowed . They are accordingly allowed . The impugned judgment is set aside . The case is remanded to the High Court for deciding the second appeal afresh on merits . The High Court will now frame proper substantial question(s ) of law after hearing the appellant and if it finds that any substantial question(s ) of law arises in the case , it will formulate such question(s ) and accordingly hear the appeal on the question(s ) framed finally in accordance with law .    18
