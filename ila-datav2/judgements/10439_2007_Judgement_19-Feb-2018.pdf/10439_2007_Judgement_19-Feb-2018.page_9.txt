19 . In our considered opinion , the manner and the procedure adopted by the High Court while allowing the second appeal are against the procedure laid down in Section 100 . 20 . Section 100 of the Code reads as under : “ 100 . Second appeal.- ( 1 ) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the body of this Code or by any other law for the time being in force , an appeal shall lie to the High Court from every decree passed in appeal by any Court subordinate to the High Court , if the High Court is satisfied that the case involves a substantial question of law . ( 2 ) An appeal may lie under this section from an appellate decree passed ex parte . ( 3 ) In an appeal under this section , the memorandum of appeal shall precisely state the substantial question of law involved in the appeal . ( 4 ) Where the High Court is satisfied that a substantial question of law is involved in any case , it shall formulate that question . ( 5 ) The appeal shall be heard on the question so formulated and the respondent shall , at the hearing of the appeal , be allowed to argue that the case does not involve such question : Provided that nothing in this sub - section shall be deemed to take away or abridge the power of the court to hear , for reasons to be recorded , the appeal on any other substantial question of law formulated by it , if it is satisfied that the case involves ’ such question . ”
