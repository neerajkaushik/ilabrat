decide the second appeal is confined only to the question framed by the High Court under sub - section(4 ) . The respondent , however , at the time of hearing of the appeal is given a right under sub - section ( 5 ) to raise an objection that the question framed by the High Court under sub - section ( 4 ) does not involve in the appeal . The reason for giving this right to the respondent for raising such objection at the time of hearing is because the High Court frames the question at the admission stage which is prior to issuance of the notice of appeal to the respondent . In other words , the question is framed behind the back of respondent and , therefore , sub - section(5 ) enables him to raise such objection at the time of hearing that the question framed does not arise in the appeal . The proviso to sub - section ( 5 ) , however , also recognizes the power of the High Court to hear the appeal on any other substantial question of law which was not initially framed by the High Court    11
