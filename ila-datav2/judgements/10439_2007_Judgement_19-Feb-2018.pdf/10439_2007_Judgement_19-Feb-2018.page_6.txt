are constrained to allow the appeals , set aside the impugned judgment and remand the case to the High Court for deciding the second appeal afresh on merits in accordance with law . 11 . The reasons for remanding the case to the High Court are more than one as _ set out hereinbelow . 12 . First , we find that the High Court allowed the second appeal filed by respondent No . 1 herein without hearing respondent No.4 before it , i.e. , ( appellant herein ) . In other words , the High Court allowed the second appeal after hearing the appellant of second appeal only and not respondent No.4 of the second appeal , who was absent at the time of hearing . 13 . When respondent No . 4 ( appellant herein ) filed an application under Section 151 read with Order 41 Rule 21 of the Code praying for an opportunity of hearing , his application was dismissed by the High Court .
