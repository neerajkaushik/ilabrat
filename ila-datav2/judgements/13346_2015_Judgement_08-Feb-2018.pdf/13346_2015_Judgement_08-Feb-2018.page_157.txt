of the enemy of the State or a general strike . ” In the aforesaid case , there was the fault on part of the State . The State failed to assert rights . The State was guilty of defaults and did not take steps within time contemplated under section 7(2 ) of the said Act . The case turned on its own facts . 133 . Reliance has also been placed in this regard on Neeraj Kumar Sainy & Ors . v. State of UP & Ors . , ( 2017 ) SCC Online SC 258 , wherein this court has observed : “ 31 . It is noticeable from the aforesaid passage that the interpretation was made in accordance with the Code and the legal maxim was taken as a guiding principle . Needless to say , it is well settled in law that no one should suffer any prejudice because of the act of the court . The authorities that we have referred to dealt with the different factual expositions . The legal maxim that has been taken recourse to can not operate in a vacuum . It has to get the sustenance from the facts . As is manifest , after the admissions were over as per the direction of this Court , the Appellants , who seemed to have resigned to their fate , woke up to have control over the events forgetting that the law does not assist the non - vigilant . One can not indulge in luxury of lethargy , possibly nurturing the feeling that forgetting is a virtue , and thereafter , when the time has slipped through , for it waits for none , wake up and take shelter under the maxim " actus curiae neminem gravabit " . It is completely unacceptable . ” The case pertains to lethargy that would depend on facts of a case to what extent benefit can be derived from legal principles . 157
