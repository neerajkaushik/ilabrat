15 percent per annum shall be payable from the date of expiry of the said period of one year till it is so paid or deposited . As soon as the deposit is made under Section 31(2 ) of the Act , liability ceases to make the payment of interest on the compensation amount so deposited . " 78 . Reliance was placed by landowners on the decision in Nazir Ahmed v. King Emperor , AIR 1936 PC 253 ( 2 ) , wherein the court observed , that “ where a power is given to do a certain thing in a certain way , the thing must be done in that way or not at all . Other methods of performance are necessarily forbidden ” . There is no dispute with the said proposition , and the same has been followed by this Court umpteen number of times . However , the consistent practice that has been followed in land acquisition cases is that it is only when reference is sought , and the amount has not been paid for one or other reason as per section 31(2 ) , that the amount is deposited in the court to which the reference would be submitted , and not otherwise . The action is as per rules . The amount of compensation , qua the incumbents / landowners who have not sought the reference , is ordinarily deposited in treasury , by opening accounts in their separate names ; the same is apparent from the forms , rules framed under section 55 of 1894 Act and various statutory orders issued by various State Governments .
