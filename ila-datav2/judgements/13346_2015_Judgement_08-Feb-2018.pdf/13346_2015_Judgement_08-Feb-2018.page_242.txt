curbed and the Court must ensure that there is no wrongful , unauthorised or unjust gain for anyone by abusing of the process of the Court . No one should be permitted to use the judicial process for earning undeserved gains for unjust profits . The Courts ’ constant endeavour should be to ensure that everyone gets just and fair treatment . 58 . “ Actus curiae neminemgravabit ’ , or the principle that an act of Court can not prejudice any of the parties , is a settled principle of law . In A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak and Anr . , ( 1988 ) 2 SCC 602 , by majority this Court held that the elementary rule of justice is that no party should suffer by a mistake or an action of the Court . Shri Kishan Das ( supra ) applied this principle to land acquisitions . 59 . It is often the case in proceedings against land acquisitions that the affected parties seek an interim stay of the acquisition proceedings until the matter has attained finality . An interim stay prevents the State from acquiring the land and following subsequent procedure under the Act , be it the publication of notifications , making of the award , taking possession of the acquired land , or paying and depositing of compensation . If the State does not adhere to the stay order , it will be held up for contempt . In such a situation , it may take months and indeed years before the matter attains finality , during which the State is prevented from carrying out the acquisition proceedings . In a given case , it may take five to ten years or more before the case passes through the Single Judge of the High Court , the Division Bench of the High Court , and finally the Supreme Court , or even sent back to the High Court to be decided afresh on some point . It may well be years before possession is taken and compensation is paid to the landowners . As stated earlier , the State is precluded from taking possession for no fault of its own . 242
