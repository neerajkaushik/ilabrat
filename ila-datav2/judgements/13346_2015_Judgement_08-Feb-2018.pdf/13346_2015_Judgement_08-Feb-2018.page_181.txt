Residential Association ( supra ) , Pune Municipal Corpn . ( supra ) , Bharat Kumar ( supra ) and Bimla Devi ( supra ) , we have already discussed the matter following Pune Municipal Corporation ( supra ) . Radiance Fincap Put . Ltd. & Ors . v. Union of India & Ors . ( 2015 ) 8 SCC 544 has also been pressed into service , it considered the second proviso to section 24(2 ) of the Ordinance that has lapsed . 145(i ) . In Working Friends Cooperative House Building Society Ltd. v. State of Punjab & Ors . ( 2016 ) 15 SCC 464 again the other decisions based on Pune Municipal Corporation ( supra ) referred to above have been followed . In Working Friends Cooperative House Building Society Ltd. ( supra ) compensation was not tendered to the appellant . When compensation was not tendered as per section 31 , it could not be said that it was paid . To that extent there is no dispute with respect to applicability of section 24(2 ) . Mere deposit in treasury or in court was not going to help the authorities as it was obligatory on them to have tendered the amount unless saved by three out of four exigencies provided in section 31(2 ) as discussed above .
