satisfy Section 31(1 ) , but Section 31(2 ) can not be satisfied without a deposit in Court . If such deposit is not made in Court , the proceedings must necessarily lapse . The observation of the Court was , “ In any case , such deposit in the treasury is referable only to Section 31(1 ) and can not ever be a substitute for deposit before the reference court as provided under Section 31(2 ) of the Land Acquisition Act , which applies in the circumstances mentioned in the aforesaid sub - section . We are , therefore , of the opinion that no distinction between the facts of this case and the facts in Pune Municipal Corporation can be drawn on this ground , and the ratio of Pune Municipal Corporation will apply on all fours to the facts of the present case . ” 9 . In The Working Friends Cooperative House Building Society Ltd. v. State of Punjab , ( 2016 ) 15 SCC 464,the deposit of compensation was made in the Treasury and not in the Court .

State of Haryana , ( 2014 ) 6 SCC 586 , applied Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act in a case where the possession was not taken and compensation had neither been paid nor deposited before the appropriate forum . It stated as follows , “ 7 . In our opinion though the award has been passed by the Land Acquisition Collector , they have not taken the physical possession of the land and have not paid the compensation to the appellant or had deposited the said compensation before an appropriate forum . ” The same rationale was adopted in Bimla Devi & Ors . v.
