of India must yield to_a statutory provision . To achieve the same purpose , the Parliament as also the State Legislatures inserted provisions in various statutes , some of which have been referred to hereinbefore providing that the statutory dues shall be the first charge over the properties of the tax - payer . This aspect of the matter has been considered by this Court in a series of judgments . ‚Äù ( Emphasis supplied )    114 . There is no dispute with the aforesaid proposition ; and , in our opinion , the statutory provisions , contained in section 24 of the Act of 2013 , do not exclude the principles of common law which we have held applicable . The principles that can be excluded are only those in respect to which , provision has been made in the statute itself or the applicability is ousted by implication . 115 . The afore - extracted observations in respect of the principle of interpretation that if something is expressed in a provision , anything contrary is impliedly excluded , are themselves based on the maxim " expressio unius est exclusio alterius " . This maxim has been held to have limit of operation and is not of universal application in Mary Angel v. State of Tamil Nadu ( 1999 ) 5 SCC 209 . Thus , mere fact that in some of the provisions there is a mention about period of stay being excluded , can not be taken to be conclusive that in other provisions with respect to the effect of stay not to be considered or common law maxims have no applicability 134
