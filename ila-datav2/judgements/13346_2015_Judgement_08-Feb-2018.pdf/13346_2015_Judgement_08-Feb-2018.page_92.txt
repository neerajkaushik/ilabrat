or physically occupy it after displacing who were physically in possession as in the case of certain private persons , in case they re - enter in possession of open land , start cultivation or residing in the house . Lawful possession is deemed to be of the State . This Court in a number of decisions has accepted the mode of drawing Panchnama by State consistently to be a mode of taking possession . 87(a ) . In Balwant Narayan Bhagde v. M.D. Bhagwat & Ors . , ( 1976 ) 1 SCC 700 in the majority view , it was held that the act of Tehsildar in going on the spot and inspecting the land was sufficient to constitute taking of possession . Neither the Government nor the Commissioner could withdraw from the acquisition of the land under section 48(1 ) of the Act . This Court observed thus : “ 28 . We agree with the conclusion reached by our brother Untwalia , J. , as also with the reasoning on which the conclusion is based . But we are writing a separate judgment as we feel that the discussion in the judgment of our learned brother Untwalia , J. , in regard to delivery of ' symbolical ' and ‘ actual ’ possession under Rules 35 , 36 , 95 and 96 of Order XXI of the CPC , is not necessary for the disposal of the present appeals ' and we do not wish to subscribe to what has been said by our learned brother Untwalia , J. , in that connection , nor do we wish to express our assent with the discussion of the various authorities made by him in his judgment . We think it is enough to state that when the Government proceeds to take possession of the land acquired by it under the Land Acquisition Act , 1894 , it must take actual possession of the land since all interests in the land are sought to be acquired by it . There can be no question of taking ' symbolical ' possession in the sense understood by judicial decisions under the CPC . 92
