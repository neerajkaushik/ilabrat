held : “ 5 . What is stipulated in Clause-4 of the letter dated 30.10.2001 is a communication regarding refusal to accept the allotment . This was done on 28.11.2001 . Respondent No . 1 can not be put to loss for the closure of the office of HUDA on 01.12.2001 and 02.12.2001 and the postal holiday on 30.11.2001 . In fact he had no control over these matters . Even the logic of Section 10 of the General Clauses Act , 1897 can be pressed into service . Apart from the said Section and various provisions in various other Acts , there is the general principle that a party prevented from doing an act by some circumstances beyond his control , can_do_so_at_the first subsequent opportunity ( see Sambasiva Chari v. Ramaswami Reddi ( 1898 ) ( 8) Madras Law Journal 265 ) . The underlying object of the principle is to enable a person to do what he could have done on a holiday , on the next working day . Where , therefore , a period is prescribed for the performance of an act in a court or office , and that period expires on a holiday , then the act should be considered to have been done within that period if it is done on the next day on which the court or office is open . The reason is that law does not compel the performance of an impossibility . ( See Hossein Ally v. Donzelle ) ILR 5 Cal 906 . Every consideration of justice and expediency would require that the accepted principle which underlies Section 10 of the General Clauses Act should be applied in cases where it does not otherwise in terms apply . The principles underlying are lex non cogit ad impossibilia ( the law does not compel a man to do the impossible ) and actus curiae _ neminem gravabit ( the act _ of Court shall prejudice no man ) . Above being the position , there is nothing infirm in the orders passed by the Forums below . However , the rate of interest fixed appears to be slightly on the higher side and is reduced to 9 % to be paid with effect from 03.12.2001 , i.e. , the date on which the letter was received by HUDA . ”      ( emphasis supplied ) 123 .
