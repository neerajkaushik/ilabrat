is in disregard of the previous decisions of the Court itself , or that it was rendered in ignorance of the terms of an applicable statute or of a rule having the force of law . 147(a ) . In practice , per incuriam , is taken to mean per ignoratium , as observed by this Court in Mamleshwar Prasad v. Kanahaiya Lal , ( 1975 ) 2 SCC 232 , thus : “ 5 . A litigant can not play fast and loose with the Court . His word to the Court is as good as his bond and we must , without more ado , negative the present shift in stand by an astute discovery of a plea that the earlier judgment was rendered per incuriam . 6 . The wisdom which has fallen from Bowen , L.J. in Ex Parte Pratt 52 Q.B. 334 , though delivered in a different context , has wider relevance to include the present position . The learned Lord Justice observed : “ There is a good old - fashioned rule that no one has a right to conduct himself before a tribunal as if he accepted its jurisdiction , and then afterwards , when he finds that it has decided against him , to turn round and say , " You have no jurisdiction " . 7 . Certainty of the law , consistency of rulings and comity of courts- all flowering from the same principle - coverage to the conclusion that a decision once rendered must later bind like cases . We do not intend to detract from the rule that , in exceptional instances , whereby obvious inadvertence or oversight a judgment fails to notice a plain statutory provision or obligatory authority running counter to the reasoning and result reached , it may not have the sway of binding precedents . It should be a glaring case , an obtrusive omission . No such situation presents itself here and we do not embark on the principle of judgment per incuriam . ” 184
