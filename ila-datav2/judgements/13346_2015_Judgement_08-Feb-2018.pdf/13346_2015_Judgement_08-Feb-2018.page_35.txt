into_an Act unless it is absolutely necessary _ to do so . " Similarly , it is wrong and dangerous to proceed by substituting some other words for words of the statute . Speaking briefly the court can not reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate .    X XXXX While interpreting section 621-A(1 ) of the Companies Act , 1956 , the Supreme Court held that the Court _ must_avoid rejection or addition of words and resort to that only in exceptional circumstances to achieve the purpose of the Act or to give a purposeful meaning to the section . Section 621-A provides for compounding , by the Company Law Board , of any offence punishable under the Act , not being an offence punishable with imprisonment only , or with imprisonment and also with fine , either before or after the institution of any prosecution . It was held that the Company Law Board has the power to compound such offences without the permission of the Court . Since the Legislature , in its wisdom , has not put the rider of prior permission in the section , addition of the words ‘ with the prior permission of the court ’ to the provision is not permissible .        Section 2(2 ) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act , 1996 , which is in Part I of the Act , provides that ‘ This Part shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India . In Bharat Aluminium Company v. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc. , a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court rejected the contention that Part I of the Act was also applicable to arbitrations seated in foreign countries on the ground that in such a case certain words would have to be added to section 2(2 ) , which would then have to provide that ‘ this part shall apply where the place of arbitration is in India and to arbitrations having its place out of India ’ . This would amount to_a_drastic_and _ unwarranted rewriting or alteration of the language of section 2(2 ) , and it is not permissible for the Court to_reconstruct_a _ statutory provision . In this case , the Constitution Bench prospectively overruled the decision of a three - Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Bhatia International v. Bulk Trading SA , which had held that provisions of Part I would apply to international commercial arbitrations held outside India unless the parties , by agreement , express or implied , exclude all or any of its provisions .        35
