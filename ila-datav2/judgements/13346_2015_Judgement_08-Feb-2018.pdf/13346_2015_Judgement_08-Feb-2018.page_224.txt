is not relevant to the determination of the issue at hand as it is a case of tenancy rights and merely reaffirms that the payment by cheque is a valid tender . 28 . To summarize , it must be emphasized that “ payment ” of compensation and “ deposit ” of compensation have been used to describe the instance where the State gives landowners their compensation . Both signify an obligation of the State . As per Section 31(1 ) , compensation must be paid to the landowners . As per Section 31(2 ) , if the landowners do not consent to receive compensation , the State shall deposit it in Court . It is often that when a beneficiary does not appear to collect compensation , the State has to depositthe compensation in the Treasury as per the relevant State Rules . But that does not mean that the State has shirked its obligation to compensate the affected persons . It may not always be the case that persons who do not appear on the appointed date are refusing to accept compensation . It may also be that such affected persons had consented to receive compensation , but simply could not appear or could not be traced for some reason or the other . There may be thousands of such beneficiaries . In such a case , the Collector can not hand over compensation to each beneficiary in person , but also can not keep the money with him . He has to keep it in the Treasury . In fact , the State Rules have been framed to give notice to the landowners that their compensation has been deposited in the Treasury instead of the Court . In light of this , there is no harm done or prejudice caused if the State deposits compensation in the Treasury when landowners do not appear . In fact , as mentioned supra the compensation deposited in Courts is often kept in the Treasury . It is merely a matter of procedure as to where the landowners who do not appear on the appointed date , or the landowners who refuse to receive compensation , shall take their compensation from the Treasury . 224
