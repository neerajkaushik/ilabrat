different objectives . When the legislature has used different expressions with respect to past events — the word “ paid ” is used in a discernibly distinctive sense than the sense conveyed by the word “ deposited ” occurring in the proviso — both are required to be given different meanings . There is casus omissus , i.e. conscious omission made by the Legislature in main Section 24(2 ) when the expression “ deposited ” has not been used in the expression “ has been paid ” , and it is only after amount tendered is declined , it is to be deposited in Court that too in certain exigencies as per section 31(2 ) . 43 . The word “ paid ” , in view of the different consequences of paid and deposited , has to be given different meaning from “ deposited ” . Otherwise , if it were the case that ‘ deposit ’ is included in the ‘ payment ’ , then there would have been no necessity of using two different expressions , in different provisions , carrying different consequences . Deposit made in the court can not be said to be payment made to the landowner 1.x persons interested / beneficiaries . Thus , in case of deposit is directly made in the court without tender , it could not be said that it was tendered or paid . ‘ Deposit in court ’ simply is the discharge of Collector ’s liability of making payment of interest as envisaged under section 40
