" 4 . It is seen that the entire gamut of the acquisition proceedings stood completed by April 17 , 1976 , by which date possession of the land had been taken . No doubt , Shri Parekh has contended that the appellant still retained their possession . It is now well - settled legal position that _ it_is difficult_to_take physical possession of the land under compulsory acquisition . The normal mode of taking possession is drafting the Panchanama in the presence of Panchas and taking possession and giving delivery to the beneficiaries is the accepted mode of taking possession of the land . Subsequent thereto , the retention of possession would tantamount only to illegal or unlawful possession .                  5 . Under these circumstances , merely because the appellant retained possession of the acquired land , the acquisition can not be said to be bad in law . It is then contended by Shri Parekh that the appellant - Institution is running an educational institution and intends to establish a public school and that since other land was available , the Government would have acquired some other land leaving the acquired land for the appellant . In the counter - affidavit filed in the High Court , it was stated that apart from the acquired land , appellant also owned 482 canals 19 marlas of land . Thereby , it is seen that the appellant is not disabled to proceed with the continuation of the educational institution which it seeks to establish . It is then contended that an opportunity may be given to the appellant to make a representation to the State Government . We find that it is not necessary for us to give any such liberty since acquisition process has already been completed . ‚Äù ( emphasis supplied ) In P. K. Kalburqi v. State of Karnataka & Ors . ( 2005 ) 12 SCC 489 , this Court held that if land were vacant and unoccupied , taking symbolical possession would be enough . This Court held that in case land was vacant only symbolical possession could be taken and such possession would amount to vesting the land in the Government . Thus power under section 48 could not be exercised . 97
