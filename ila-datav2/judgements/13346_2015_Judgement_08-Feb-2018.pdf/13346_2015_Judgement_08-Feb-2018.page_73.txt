the landowner in the event of the compensation not being paid or deposited in time in court . Before taking possession of the land , the Collector has to pay or deposit the amount awarded , as stated in Section 31 , failing which he is liable to pay interest as provided in Section 34 . 6 . In the circumstances , the High Court was right in stating that interest was due and payable to the landowner . The High Court was justified in directing the necessary parties to appear in the executing court for determination of the amount . ‚Äù 73 . In Kishan Das & Ors . v. State of U.P. & Ors . ( 1995 ) 6 SCC 240 this Court has laid down that in case the landowners have themselves delayed in disposal of acquisition proceedings , can not claim higher rate of interest as that would amount to payment of premium for dilatory tactics . Even the interest under section 34 can not be claimed as a matter of right . In case a person is indulging in litigation for adopting dilatory tactics , no divesting of land is provided under the Act of 1894 in case it is not deposited in court . Neither it is so provided in section 24(1 ) of the 2013 Act . The obligation to pay is discharged as soon as it is tendered unconditionally and made available to the landowners . Thereafter there is no further obligation to deposit it in court so as to save the acquisition . Only to save acquiring body from liability to pay interest at exorbitant rates , it may be deposited in court in certain cases where reference court comes into picture to discharge 73
