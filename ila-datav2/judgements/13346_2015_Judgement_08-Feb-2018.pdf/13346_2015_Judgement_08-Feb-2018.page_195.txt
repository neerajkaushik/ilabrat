of the Act of 1894 . The words ‘ paid'/tender ' and ‘ deposited ’ are different expressions and carry different meanings within their fold . In section 24(2 ) of the Act of 2013 in the expression ‘ paid , ' it is not necessary that the amount should be deposited in court as provided in section 31(2 ) of the Act of 1894 . Non - deposit of compensation in court under section 31(2 ) of the Act of 1894 does not result in a lapse of acquisition under section 24(2 ) of the Act of 2013 . Due to the failure of deposit in court , the only consequence at the most in appropriate cases may be of a higher rate of interest on compensation as envisaged under section 34 of the Act of 1894 and not lapse of acquisition . Once the amount of compensation has been unconditionally tendered and it is refused , that would amount to payment and the obligation under section 31(1 ) stands discharged and that amounts to discharge of obligation of payment under section 24(2 ) of the Act of 2013 also and it is not open to the person who has refused to accept compensation , to urge that since it has not been deposited in court , acquisition has lapsed . Claimants / landowners after refusal , can not take advantage of their own wrong and seek protection under the provisions of section 24(2 ) . 195
