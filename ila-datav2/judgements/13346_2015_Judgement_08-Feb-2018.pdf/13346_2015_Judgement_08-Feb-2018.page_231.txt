45 . A two - Judge bench of this Court in Sree Balaji ( supra)held that casus omissus could not be supplied to Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act , as the Legislature has amended other Sections in the same Act to exclude period of stay by the Court , while leaving Section 24(2 ) intact . It observed as follows : “ 11 . From a plain reading of Section 24 of the 2013 Act it is clear that Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act does not exclude any period during which the land acquisition proceeding might have remained stayed on account of stay or injunction granted by any court . In the same Act , the proviso to Section 19(7 ) in the context of limitation for publication of declaration under Section 19(1 ) and the Explanation to Section 69(2 ) for working out the market value of the land in the context of delay between preliminary notification under Section 11 and the date of the award , specifically provide that the period or periods during which the acquisition proceedings were held up on account of any stay or injunction by the order of any court be excluded in computing the relevant period . In that view of the matter it can be safely concluded that the Legislature has consciously omitted to extend the period of five years indicated in Section 24(2 ) even if the proceedings had been delayed on account of an order of stay or injunction granted by a court of law or for any reason . Such casus omissus can not be supplied by the court in view of law on the subject elaborately discussed by this Court in the case of Padma Sundara Rao v. State of T.N. [ ( 2002 ) 3 SCC 533 ] . 12 . Even in the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 , the Legislature had brought about amendment in Section 6 through an Amendment Act of 1984 to add Explanation 1 for the purpose of excluding the period when the proceeding suffered stay by an order of the court , in the context of limitation provided for publishing the declaration under Section 6(1 ) of the Act . To a similar effect was Explanation to Section 11A which was added by Amendment Act 68 of 1984 . Clearly the Legislature has , in its wisdom , made the period of five years under Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act absolute and unaffected by any delay in the proceedings on account of any order of stay by a court . The plain wordings used by the Legislature are clear and do not create any ambiguity or conflict . In such a situation , the court is not required to depart from the literal rule of interpretation . ” 46 . In Padma Sundara Rao v. State of Tamil Nadu,(2002 ) 3 SCC 533 this Court held that a Court can not supply casus omissus into Section 6 of the 1894 Act . After the High Court quashes a declaration made under Section 6 , there is no provision for a further limitation period of one year for a fresh Section 6 declaration to run from the date 231
