87(g ) . In Raghbir Singh Sehrawat v. State of Haryana & Ors . ( 2012 ) 1 SCC 792 , it was observed : “ 28 . If the Appellant 's case is examined in the light of the propositions culled out in Banda Development Authority , Banda v. MotiLalAgarwal and Ors . we have no hesitation to hold that possession of the acquired land had not been taken from the Appellant on 28.11.2008 , i.e. the day on which the award was declared by the Land Acquisition Collector because crops were standing on several parcels of land including the Appellant 's land and possession thereof could not have been taken without giving notice to the landowners . That apart , it was humanly impossible to give notice to large number of persons on the same day and take actual possession of land comprised in various survey numbers ( total measuring 214 Acres 5 Kanals and 2 Marlas ) . ” This Court has laid down that since the land was lying fallow with no crop on it , the Tehsildar going on the spot and inspecting the land was enough to constitute taking possession . No notice was required to be given to the occupant of the land . 87(h ) . In Sita Ram Bhandar Society , New Delhi v. Lieutenant Governor , Government of NCT , Delhi & Ors . ( 2009 ) 10 SCC 501 , this Court observed that when possession is to be taken of large tract of land then it is permissible to have possession by drawing Panchnama . 98
