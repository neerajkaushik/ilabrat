and dishonest litigation . 192 . The court 's constant endeavour must be to ensure that everyone gets just and fair treatment . The court while rendering justice must adopt a pragmatic approach and in appropriate cases realistic costs and compensation be ordered in order to discourage dishonest litigation . The object and true meaning of the concept of restitution cannot_be achieved or accomplished unless the courts adopt _ a pragmatic approach in dealing with the cases . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 140(d ) . In Krishnaswamy S. Pd . & Anr v. Union of India & Ors . , Civil Appeal Nos.3376 - 3377 of 2000 decided on 21.02.2006 this Court has considered the question of restitution . This court has relied upon Eastern Coalfield ’s case ( supra ) and observed : “ The maxim ‘ actus curiae neminem gravabit ' i.e. an act of Court shall prejudice no man is an important one . The maxim " is founded upon justice and good sense , and affords a safe and certain guide for the administration of the law " , said Cresswell J. in Freeman v. Tranah ( 12 C.B. 406 ) . An unintentional mistake of the Court which may prejudice the cause of any party must and alone could be rectified . The maxim of equity , namely , actus curiae neminem gravabit : an act of court shall prejudice no man , is founded upon justice and good sense which serves a safe and certain guide for the administration of law . The other relevant maxim is , lex non cogit ad impossibilia : the law does not compel a man to do what he can not possibly perform . The law itself and_its administration is understood to disclaim as it does in its general aphorisms , all intention of compelling impossibilities , and the administration of law must adopt that general exception in the consideration of particular cases .
