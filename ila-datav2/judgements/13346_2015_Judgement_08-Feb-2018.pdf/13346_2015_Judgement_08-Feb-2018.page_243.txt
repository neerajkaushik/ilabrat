60 . Failing to supply casus omissus will lead to a situation where the acquisition proceedings will lapse solely to the detriment of the State due to an act of the party to the litigation and at the intervention of the Court , namely an order of interim stay . Large amounts of public money will go to waste in keeping the proceedings pending . While the Act is admittedly a beneficial legislation , it can not be that the landowners cause a validly initiated acquisition to lapse by filing cases and continuously delaying acquisition or legal proceedings . Justice must be done to all parties to litigation . It will not serve the purpose of the enactment if the State is stopped from completing the acquisition for no mistake of its own , while certain opportunistic litigants seek to frustrate the State â€™s attempts at legally acquiring the land . 61 . In fact , when the Legislature has excluded interim stay orders in other provisions of the same Act , there is nothing that prevents this Court from applying these exclusions ejusdem generis to Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act . Thus , the period of interim stay must necessarily be excluded for the purposes of calculation of the time period under Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act . 62 . It follows then that the absence of a specific amendment by the Legislature to Section 24(2 ) does not make a substantial difference to the legal position on excluding the period of interim stay for the purposes of calculating five years under Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act . In other words , the period of five years must necessarily exclude such period of stay orders . 243
