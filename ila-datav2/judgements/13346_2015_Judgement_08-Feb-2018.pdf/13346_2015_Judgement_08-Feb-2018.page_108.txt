Ltd. v. K.P. Madhavan Kutty ( 2000 ) I LLJ 561 SC ; Balbir Singh v. Punjab Roadways 2000 ( 8) SCALE 180 ; Asst . Executive Engineer v. Shivalinga ( 2002 ) I LLJ 457 SC ; and S.M. Nilajkar v. Telecom DT . Manager ( 2003 ) II LLJ 359 SC . When belated claims are considered as stale and non - existing for the purpose of refusing or rejecting a reference under Section 10(1)(c ) or ( d ) , in spite of no period of limitation being prescribed , it will be illogical to hold that the amendment to the Act inserting Section 10(4A ) prescribing a time limit of six months , should be interpreted as reviving all stale and dead claims . 30 . The object of Section 10(4A ) is to enable workmen to apply directly to the Labour Court for adjudication of disputes relating to termination , without going through the laborious process of seeking a reference under Section 10(1 ) of ID Act . The Legislative intent was not to revive stale or non - existing claims . Section 10(4A ) clearly requires that a workman who wants to directly approach the Labour Court should do so within six months from the date of communication of the order . Then come the words " or the date of commencement of the Industrial Disputes ( Karnataka Amendment ) Act , 1987 , whichever is later " . The reason for these words is obvious . In cases where the cause of action arose prior to 7.4.1988 , some additional time had to be provided to make the provisions effective . Let us take the example of a workman who had received the termination order on 10 - 10 - 1987 . If Section 10(4A ) , which come into effect on 7.4.1988 , had merely stated that the application had to be filed within six months from the date of communication , he had to file the application before 10 - 4 - 1988 , that is hardly three days from the date when the amendment came into effect . The Legislature thought that workmen should be given some reasonable time to know about the new provision and take steps to approach the Labour Court . Therefore , all workmen who were communicated orders of termination within six months prior to 7 - 4 - 1988 were given the benefit of uniform six months time from 7 - 4 - 1988 , irrespective of the date of expiry of six months . When a new remedy or relief is provided by a statute , such a transitional provision is made to ensure that persons who are given a special right , do not lose it for want of adequate time to enforce it , though they have a cause of action or right as on the date when the new remedy or relief comes into effect . 108
