mistake . Mahajan , J. speaking for a four - Judge Bench in Kishan Deo v. Radha Kissen [ 1953]4SCR136 stated : The Judge had jurisdiction to correct his own error without entering into a discussion of the grounds taken by the decree - holder or the objections raised by the judgment - debtors . ” 131(h).The Constitution Bench in Sarah Mathew v. Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases , ( 2014 ) 2 SCC 62 , has considered the aforesaid maxim ; it observed : “ 39 . As we have already noted in reaching this conclusion , light can be drawn from legal maxims . Legal maxims are referred to in Bharat Kale , Japani Sahoo and Vanka Radhamanohari ( Smt . ) . The object of the criminal law is to punish perpetrators of crime . This is in tune with the well known legal maxim ' nullum tempus aut locus occurritregi ' , which means that a crime never dies . At the same time , it is also the policy of law to assist the vigilant and not the sleepy . This is expressed in the Latin maxim ' vigilantibus et non dormientibus , jura subveniunt ' . Chapter XXXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides limitation period for certain types of offences for which lesser sentence is provided draws support from this maxim . But , even certain offences such as Section 384 or 465 of the Indian Penal Code , which have lesser punishment may have serious _ social consequences . Provision is , therefore , made for condonation of delay . Treating date of filing of complaint or date of initiation of proceedings as the relevant date for computing limitation under Section 468 of the Code is supported by the legal maxim ' actus curiae neminem gravabit ' which means that the act of court shall prejudice no man . It bears repetition to_state that the court 's inaction in taking cognizance i.e. court 's inaction in applying mind to the suspected_offence should not be allowed to cause prejudice to _ a_diligent complainant . Chapter XXXVI thus presents the interplay of these three legal maxims . Provisions of this Chapter , however , are not interpreted solely on the basis of these maxims . They only serve as guiding principles . ”              ( emphasis supplied ) 155
