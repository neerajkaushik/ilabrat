â€œ 28 . From the aforesaid decisions the legal position that emerges is that when a repeal of an enactment is followed by a_fresh legislation such legislation does not _ affect_the substantive rights of the parties on the date of suit_or adjudication of suit unless such a legislation is retrospective and_a court of appeal can not take into consideration a new law brought into existence after the judgment appealed from has been rendered because the rights of the parties in an appeal are determined under the law in force on the date of suit . However , the position in law would be different in the matters which relate to procedural law but so far as substantive rights of parties are concerned they remain unaffected by the amendment in the enactment . We are , therefore , of the view that where a repeal of provisions of an enactment is followed by fresh legislation by an amending Act such legislation is prospective in operation and does not affect substantive or vested rights of the parties unless made retrospective either expressly or by necessary intendment . We are further of the view that there is a presumption against the retrospective operation of a statue and further a statute is not to be construed to have a greater retrospective operation than its language renders necessary , but an amending act which affects the procedure is presumed to be retrospective unless amending act provides otherwise . We have carefully looked into new substituted section 15 brought in the parent Act by Amendment Act 1995 but do not find it either expressly or by necessary implication retrospective in operation which may affect the right of the parties on the date of adjudication of suit and the same is required to be taken into consideration by the appellate Court .

We are respectfully in agreement with the view expressed in the said decision and hold that the substituted Section 15 in the absence of anything in it to show that it is retrospective , does not affect the right of the parties which accrued to them on the date of suit or on the date of passing of the decree by the Court of the first instance . We are also of the view that present appeals are unaffected by change in law in so far it related to determination of the 122
