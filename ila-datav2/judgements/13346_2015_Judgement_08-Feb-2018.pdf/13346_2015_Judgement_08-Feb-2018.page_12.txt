( 3 ) Notwithstanding anything in this section the Collector may , with the sanction of the [ appropriate Government ] instead of awarding a money compensation in respect of any land , make any arrangement with a person having a limited interest in such land , either by the grant of other lands in exchange , the remission of land - revenue on other lands held under the same title , or in such other way as may be equitable having regard to the interests of the parties concerned . ( 4 ) Nothing in the last foregoing sub - section shall be construed to interfere with or limit the power of the Collector to enter into any arrangement with any person interested in the land and competent to contract in respect thereof . ‚Äù 9 . The provision of section 31(2 ) makes it clear that only in the exigencies as provided in section 31(2 ) , the amount has to be deposited in reference court , not in all exigencies . As discussed hereinafter rules framed under section 55 provide that in case a person seeks no reference and he refuses to accept the compensation it has to be deposited in the treasury . An attempt has to be made to harmonize the Act and the rules . The expression used in section 31(2 ) is that on refusal amount to be deposited in Court where reference would be submitted . When no reference is sought there is no question of it being submitted to the Court . Hence , Reference Court does not come into picture then the deposit is to be obviously made in treasury as provided in Rules/ Order discussed hereinafter . 12
