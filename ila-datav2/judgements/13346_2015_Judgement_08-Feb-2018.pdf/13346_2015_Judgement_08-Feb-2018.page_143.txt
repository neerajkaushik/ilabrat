( v ) The maxim of law impotentia excusat legem is intimately connected with another maxim of law lex non cogit ad impossibilia . Impotentia excusat legem is that when there is a necessary or invincible disability to perform the mandatory part of the law that impotentia excuses , The law does not compel one to do that which one can not possibly perform . " Where the law creates a duty or charge , and the party is disabled to perform it , without any default in him , and has no remedy over it , there the law will in general excuse him . " Therefore , when it appears that the performance of the formalities prescribed by a _ statute has been rendered impossible by circumstances over which the persons interested _ had no control , like the act of God , the circumstances will be taken as a valid excuse . Where the act of God prevents the compliance of the words of a statute , the statutory provision is not denuded of its mandatory character because of supervening impossibility caused by the act of God .

Directorate of Enforcement , AIR 2005 ( 2 ) SC 2622 , this court held that there is an acceptable legal maxim that law does not compel a man to do that which can not possibly be performed “ impotentia excusat legem ” . Basic principle of law is that law compels no impossibility . It was urged that in case the landowners create such circumstances , which renders impossible performance of the statutorily prescribed formalities , such landowners could n’t take advantage of their own act or wrong . 143
