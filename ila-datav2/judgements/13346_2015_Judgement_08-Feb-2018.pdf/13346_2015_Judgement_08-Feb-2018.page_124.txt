105(g ) . This Court in Sarah Mathew v. Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases , ( 2014 ) 2 SCC 62 , relied upon decision in DauDayal ( supra ) and observed : â€œ 29 . Section 473 reads as under : 473 . Extension of period of limitation in certain cases . - Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this Chapter , any Court may take cognizance of an offence after the expiry of the period of limitation , if it is satisfied on the facts and in the circumstances of the case that the delay has been properly explained or that it is necessary so to do in the interests of justice . 37 . We are inclined to take this view also because there has to be some amount of certainty or definiteness in matters of limitation relating to criminal offences . If , as stated by this Court , taking cognizance is application of mind by the Magistrate to the suspected offence , the subjective element comes in . Whether a Magistrate has taken cognizance or not will depend on facts and circumstances of each case . A diligent complainant or the prosecuting agency which promptly files the complaint or initiates prosecution would be severely prejudiced if it is held that the relevant point for computing limitation would be the date on which the Magistrate takes cognizance . The complainant or the prosecuting agency would be entirely left at the mercy of the Magistrate , who may take cognizance after the limitation period because of several reasons ; systemic or otherwise . It can not be the intention of the legislature to throw a diligent complainant out of the court in this manner . Besides it must be noted that the complainant approaches the court for redressal of his grievance . He wants action to be taken against the perpetrators of crime . The courts functioning under the criminal justice system are created for this purpose . It would be unreasonable to take a view that delay caused by the court in taking cognizance of a case would deny justice to a diligent complainant . Such an interpretation of Section 468 of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be unsustainable and would render it unconstitutional . It is well settled that a court of law would interpret_a _ provision which would help        124
