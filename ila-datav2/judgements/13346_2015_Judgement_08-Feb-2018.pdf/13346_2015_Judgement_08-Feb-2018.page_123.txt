substantive rights of the parties and the same are required to be decided in light of law of preemption as it existed on the date of passing of the decree . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 105(f ) . In Dau Dayal v. State of Uttar Pradesh , AIR 1959 SC 433 , it was observed that in case complaint has been filed within time and in case issue of process is permitted by the court , it was held that it would be an unfortunate state of the law if the trader whose rights had been infringed and who takes up the matter promptly before the criminal court , is nevertheless denied redress owing to the delay in the issue of process which occurs in court . The Court observed : “ 6.It will be noticed that the complainant is required to resort to the Court within one year of the discovery of the offence if he is to have the benefit of proceeding under the Act . That means that if the complaint is presented within one year of such discovery , the requirements of Section 15 are satisfied . The period of limitation , it should be remembered , is intended to operate against the complainant and to ensure diligence on his part in prosecuting his rights , and not against the Court . Now , it will defeat the object of the enactment and deprive traders of the protection which the law intended to give them if we were to hold that unless process is issued on their complaint within one year of the discovery of the offence , it should be thrown out . It will be an unfortunate state of the law if the trader whose rights had been infringed and who takes up the matter promptly before the Criminal Court is nevertheless , denied redress owing to the delay in the issue of process which occurs in Court . ” ( emphasis supplied )    123
