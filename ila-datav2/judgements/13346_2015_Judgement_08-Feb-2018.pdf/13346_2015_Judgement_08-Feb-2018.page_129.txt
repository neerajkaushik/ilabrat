the acquisition , can not be permitted to ask for compensation or claim lapse under 2013 Act . 110 . In Shivraj ( supra ) , this court did not consider the question of exclusion of the time .

State of Tamil Nadu & Ors . , ( 2002 ) 3 SCC 533 , in which this court considered casus omissus and observed : â€œ 12 . The rival pleas regarding re - writing of statute and casus omissus need careful consideration . It is well settled principle in law that the Court can not read anything into a statutory provision which is plain and unambiguous . A statute is an edict of the legislature . The language employed in a statute is the determinative factor of legislative intent . The first and primary rule of construction is that the intention of the Legislation must be found in the words used by the Legislature itself .

Judge Learned Hand said , " but words must be construed with some imagination of the purposes which lie behind them " . ( See Lehigh Valley Coal Co. v. Yensavage 218 FR 547 ) .
