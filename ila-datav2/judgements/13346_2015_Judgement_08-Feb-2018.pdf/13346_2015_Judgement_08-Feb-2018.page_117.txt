with respect to payment of compensation . Thus compensation ought to have been paid . While raising aforesaid submission the basic concept of acquisition under 1894 Act is ignored and overlooked as right to receive compensation is a statutory right and that comes into being only when the Government takes possession of the property acquired . It is a ‘ right in debitum in praesenti ’ , and not dependent on the quantum of the compensation , either by the Land Acquisition Officer under section 11 of the Act or by Court under section 26 of the Act of 1894 . Section 17(1 ) also provides that compensation has to be offered when the possession is taken and in case interim stay on possession is obtained in any litigation or orders of status quo and or such other order is passed , it is not open to such persons to contend that they ought to have been paid the compensation notwithstanding that they have been resisting the acquisition and taking of possession . 104 . In our opinion , when there is interim stay with respect to possession or order of status quo or stay on further proceedings etc . , there is no justification for authorities to proceed any further with respect to payment of compensation or otherwise as these obligations are intertwined in the scheme of land acquisition . 117
