under section 31(1 ) is complete by tender , and that tantamount to making the payment ; and , that is precisely what is intended by the word “ paid ” in section 24(2 ) of 2013 Act . 29 . In Section 31(2 ) of the 1894 Act , the word ‘ deposited in Court ’ is used . The deposit in Court is not payment to the beneficiaries . It is only after their refusal to accept the compensation tendered under section 31(1 ) of the Act of 1894 it is to be deposited in Court . It is further provided in the rules that in case of reference is sought , the amount is to be deposited in court where reference would be submitted otherwise it is to be deposited in the treasury . If the expression “ deposited ” , used in the proviso to section 24(2 ) , and expression “ paid ” used in main section 24(2 ) , are both taken as contained in expression “ paid ” ie . the tender ; and , on refusal it is deposited in court to make the “ payment ” complete ; if expression “ deposited ” is included in expression ‘ payment ’ under Section 24(2 ) , inconsistency and repugnancy would be caused as between the proviso and the main sub - section ; which has to be eschewed . The Court can not add the word " deposited " to the expression “ paid”/ “ tender ” in Section 31 of Act 1894 or Section 24(2 ) of Act of 2013 . 26
