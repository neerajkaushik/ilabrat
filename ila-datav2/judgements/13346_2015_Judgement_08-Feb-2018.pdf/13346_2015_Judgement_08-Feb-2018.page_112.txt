the dead or stale claims and the matters , which have been contested up to this Court or even in the High Court having lost the cases or where reference has been sought for enhancement of the compensation . Compensation obtained and still it is urged that physical possession has not been taken from them , such claims can not be entertained under the guise of section 24(2 ) . We have come across the cases in which findings have been recorded that by which of drawing a Panchnama , possession has been taken , now again under Section 24(2 ) it is asserted again that physical possession is still with them . Such claims can not be entertained in view of the previous decisions in which such plea ought to have been raised and such decisions would operate as res judicata or constructive res judicata . As either the plea raised is negatived or such plea ought to have been raised or was not raised in the previous round of litigation . Section 24 of the Act of 2013 does not supersede or annul the court â€™s decision and the provisions can not be misused to reassert such claims once over again . Once Panchnama has been drawn and by way of drawing the Panchnama physical possession has been taken , the case can not be reopened under the guise of section 24 of Act of 2013 . 112
