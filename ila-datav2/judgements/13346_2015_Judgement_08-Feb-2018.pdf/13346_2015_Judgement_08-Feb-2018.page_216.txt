land - loser is entitled to the higher compensation as per the provisions of the 2013 Act . Since the proviso does not refer to the words “ payment of compensation ” and as the main provision i.e. sub - section 2 of Section 24 does not refer to the word “ deposit ” , the only interpretation that is possible is that , if either deposit is made in the Treasury in the name of minority holders or payment is made at least to minority holders , the acquisition does not lapse . If the word “ paid ” as found in sub - section 2 of Section 24 is not treated as “ deposited ” in the account of beneficiaries , then the proviso to sub - section 2 of Section 24 would become otiose . It is well settled that no provision under the act can be rendered nugatory or otiose . 16 . Section 31 of the 1894 Act is akin to Section 77 of the 2013 Act . Of course , under Section 77 of the 2013 Act , the legislature has gone a step further and has mandated the Collector to pay the compensation awarded by him to the persons interested by depositing the amount in their bank accounts unless prevented by some or more contingencies provided under sub - section 2 . Under Section 80 of the 2013 Act , which is akin to Section 34 of the 1894 Act , the Collector shall pay the amount awarded with interest thereon at the rate of 9 % or 15 % , as the case may be , in case the amount of such compensation is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land . Thus , it is clear that Section 80 also recognises deposit of compensation as being equivalent to payment of compensation . Even under Section 34 of the 1894 Act , the land loser will be entitled to compensation with interest at the rate of 9 % or 15 % , as the case may be , in case the compensation is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession of the land . Thus , the word “ deposit ” is treated synonymous with the word “ payment ” . 216
