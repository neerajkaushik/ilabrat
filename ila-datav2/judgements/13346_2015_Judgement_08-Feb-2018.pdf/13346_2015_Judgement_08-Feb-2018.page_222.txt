Court deposit under the rules applicable to such deposits , untilits investment as required by section 32 ibid . ” 23 . Rule 10 of the Uttar Pradesh Rules for the Payment of Compensation for Land Taken Up Under the Land Acquisition Act | of 1894 provides for the money paid in Court to be credited as Civil Court Deposits , the accounts of which are ultimately kept by the Treasury ( according to paragraph 355 of Chapter XV of the Financial Handbook issued by the Government of U.P. ) . Rule 10 of the above Rules states that : “ 10 . All payments into Court for deposit under the Act should be made by means of cheques in favour of the presiding officer of the Court , payable by order of the Court to credit of Civil Court Deposits . The cheques should be accompanied by receipts in triplicate in form D , duly filled up , of which one will be retained by the Court for record , and the other two returned duly signed to the Collector . The amounts deposited in the Court will be charged off as expenditure in the public works accounts of the Collector , and the ultimate payments to the persons interested under the award shall be arranged for by the Court under the rules for the payment of Civil Court Deposits . ” Thus , it is not the position that a deposit in Court is the only legal form of deposit under the 1894 Act . Compensation was being credited to the Treasury in the past , even after the same was deposited in Court . Thus , the issue where the compensation is deposited is a matter of procedure . 24 . When the State Rules and High Court rules permit deposits in the Treasury , it falls to reason that under the scheme of the 1894 Act , failure to pay or deposit in Court under Section 31(2 ) only had the effect of attracting interest payment as per Section 34 of the 1894 Act . 222 .
