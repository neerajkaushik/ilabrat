in case either the physical possession of the land has not been taken , or the compensation has not been paid , the acquisition proceedings shall be deemed to have lapsed . However , the proviso to sub - section 2 of Section 24 emphasizes that after the award is made , if compensation in respect of majority of the land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiary , then the owners of minority of the land holdings will be entitled to compensation under the 2013 Act , which means that under the proviso , though the owners of a minority of the land holdings have received compensation under the 1894 Act , they would be getting higher compensation under the 2013 Act in case compensation has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries in respect of a majority of the land holdings . The word “ deposit ” in the account of beneficiaries as contained in proviso to section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act would mean deposit in the account of beneficiaries in the Treasury . The proviso does not refer to the word “ payment ” , as is referred to in the main provision , i.e. , sub - section 2 of Section 24 of the 2013 Act . The proviso to sub - section 2 of Section 24 does not require the State to pay the compensation in respect of minority holdings for saving acquisition . It would be sufficient if the compensation is deposited in respect of minimum holdings in the account for saving the acquisition . Since the proviso to sub - section 2 of Section 24 does not envisage lapsing of acquisition , even if the payment is not made but is deposited that too with regard to the beneficiaries of a minority of holdings , the same would lead to the inevitable conclusion that the word “ payment ” as found in sub - section 2 of Section 24 has a strong link or co - relation with the word “ deposit ” . A reading of sub - section 2 of Section 24 along with the proviso would make it clear that even if the compensation in respect of minority of the land holdings is deposited in the account of such minority beneficiaries , the acquisition does not lapse .
