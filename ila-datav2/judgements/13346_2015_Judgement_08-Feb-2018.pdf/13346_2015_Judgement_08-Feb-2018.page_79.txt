of land is contemplated . It is only in exigencies provided deemed lapse take place either when possession not taken or compensation not paid as provided in Section 24(2 ) and where award has not been passed , the provisions of section 24 of Act of 2013 applies . In a catena of decisions , this Court has laid down that as provided in section 16 of the Act of 1894 , when an award is passed and possession is taken , the land vests absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances the only legality of procedure is open to being questioned . The provision contained in section 17(1 ) also provides absolute vesting in the Government free from all encumbrances in the case of urgency even before passing of an award . 80 . The vested right can not be taken away . In Black 's Law Dictionary " vested " is defined thus : “ vested , adj . ( 18c ) Having become a _ completed , consummated right for present or future enjoyment ; not contingent ; unconditional ; absolute a vested interest in the estate . “ Unfortunately , the word ‘ vested ’ is used in two senses . Firstly , an interest may be vested in possession , when there is a right to present enjoyment , e.g. when I own and occupy Blackacre . But an interest may be vested , even where it does not carry a right to immediate possession if it does confer a fixed right of taking possession in the future . " George Whitecross 79
