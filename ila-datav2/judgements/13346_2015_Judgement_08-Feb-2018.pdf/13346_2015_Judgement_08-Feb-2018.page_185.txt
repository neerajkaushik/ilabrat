147(b ) . In A.R. Anutulay v. R.S. Nayak , ( 1988 ) 2 SCC 602 , this Court has observed : “ 42 . It appears that when this Court gave the aforesaid directions on 16th February 1984 , for the disposal of the case against the appellant by the High Court , the directions were given oblivious of the relevant provisions of law and the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar 's case ( supra ) . See Halsbury 's Laws of England , 4th End , Vol . 26 , page 297 , para 578 and page 300 , the relevant notes 8 , 11 and 15 ; Dias on Jurisprudence , 5th Edn . , pages 128 and 130 ; Young v. Bristol Aeroplane Co. Ltd. [ 1944 ] 2 AER 293 . Also see the observations of Lord Goddard in Moore v. Hewitt [ 1947 ] 2 A.E.R. 270-A and Penny v. Nicholas [ 1950 ] 2 A.E.R. 89 . " per incuriam " are those decisions given in ignorance or forgetfulness of some inconsistent statutory provision or of some authority binding on the Court concerned , so that in such cases some part of the decision or some step in the reasoning on which it is based , is found , on that account to be demonstrably wrong . See Morelle v. Wakeling [ 1955 ] 1 All E.R. 708 . Also , see State of Orissa v. The Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. [ 1985]3SCR26 . We are of the opinion that in view of the clear provisions of Section 7(2 ) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act , 1952 and Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution , these directions were legally wrong . ” 47 . In support of the contention that a direction to delete wholly the impugned direction of this Court be given , reliance was placed on Satyadhvan Ghoshal v. Deorajini Devi [ 1960 ] 3 SCR 590 . The ratio of the decision as it appears from pages 601 to 603 is that the judgment which does not terminate the proceedings , can be challenged in an appeal from final proceedings . It may be otherwise if subsequent proceedings were independent ones . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 147(c ) . In State of Uttar Pradesh v. Synthetics and Chemicals Ltd. , ( 1991 ) 4 SCC 139 , as to per incuriam this court has observed : 185
