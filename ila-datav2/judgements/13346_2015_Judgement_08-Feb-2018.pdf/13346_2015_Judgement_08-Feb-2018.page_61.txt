stay and contesting it for decades reflects clear conduct of nonacceptance of acquisition / compensation . State authorities can not retain the money in their own hands in such circumstances and are bound to deposit the Government money where it is supposed to be ie . in the treasury as provided in rules . Thus , by conduct also , there can be non - acceptance of compensation . Once compensation is accepted , right to challenge acquisition would vanish . State authorities are not expected to retain the money with them and run after the landowners and match with their dilatory tactics with vigil to find out that one ultimate day , the litigation would attain finality . Once by their conduct , there is refusal to accept the land acquisition itself , much less compensation , in such circumstances such landowners have to inform the authorities about the outcome of the litigation and in case they have lost , to ask for compensation . Authorities are not supposed to be on vigil so as to ascertain after lapse of so much time even after decades in new generation , who has received the compensation and who has not received the compensation . There is no such data readily available to them . Thus once by conduct , such landowners refuse to accept the land acquisition / compensation , so as to saddle liability 61
