52 . As mentioned supra , Sree Balaji ( supra ) has ruled that casus omissus can not be supplied to the provision in question . The decision in Sree Balaji ( Supra ) has relied on Padma Sundara Rao ( supra ) . However , the reason for not supplying casus omissus was different in that case . In Padma Sundara Rao ( supra ) , the language of Section 6(1 ) and its proviso are such , that it would make it difficult to have any distinction between the two limitation periods in the proviso , if the starting point of the limitation period itself was changed from the Section 4 notification to another undecided starting point by supplying casus omissus . In the facts of Sree Balaji ( supra ) as well as in the facts of the present case , however , there is nothing in the language of Section 24(2 ) that would defeat the purpose of the Section if the period of interim stays were excluded . Shiv Raj ( supra ) does not specifically help the case of the landowners as it did not consider the question of orders of stay on the acquisition proceedings . 53 . As already observed in the previous paragraph , if literal construction of a particular clause leads to manifestly absurd or anomalous results which could not have been intended by the Legislature ; where , to apply words literally would defeat the obvious intention of the legislation and produce a wholly unreasonable result , we must feed something to the provision so as to achieve the obvious intention and produce rational construction . 54 . | Casus omissus means an omitted case . When a statute or an instrument of writing undertakes to foresee and to provide for certain contingencies , and through mistake , or some other cause , a case remains to be provided for , it is said to be a casus omissus . 238
