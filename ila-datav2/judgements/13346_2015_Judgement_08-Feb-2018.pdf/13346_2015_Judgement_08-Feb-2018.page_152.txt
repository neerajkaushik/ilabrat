for the order of the Court and the act of such party , then the successful party finally held entitled to a relief , assessable in terms of money at the end of the litigation , is entitled to be compensated in the same manner in which the parties would have been if the interim order of the Court would not have been passed . The successful party can demand ( a ) the delivery of benefit earned by the opposite party under the interim order of the Court , or ( b ) to make restitution for what it has lost .        11 . In the facts of this case , in spite of the judgment of the High Court , if the appellants would not have persuaded this Court to pass the interim orders , they would not have been entitled to operate the mining leases and to raise and remove and disposed of the minerals extracted . But for the interim orders passed by this Court , there is no difference between the appellants and any person raising , without any lawful authority , any mineral from any land , attracting applicability of Sub - section ( 5 ) of Section 21 . As the appellants have lost from the Court they can not be allowed to retain the benefit earned by them under the interim orders of the Court . The High Court has rightly held the appellants liable to be placed in the same position in which they would have been if this Court would not have protected them_by issuing interim_orders . All that the State Government is demanding from the appellants is the price of the minor minerals . Rent , royalty or tax has already been recovered by the State Government and , therefore , there is no demand under that Head . No penal proceedings , much less any criminal proceedings , have been initiated against the appellants . It is absolutely incorrect to contend that the appellants are being asked to pay any penalty or are being subjected to any penal action . It is not the case of the appellants that they are being asked to pay a price more than what they have realised from the exports or that the price appointed by the respondent State is in any manner arbitrary or unreasonable ...........
