to challenge the legality of acquisition proceedings . This Court has laid down thus : â€œ 2 . Shri P.P. Rao , learned senior counsel for the petitioner , contends that the petitioner had no knowledge of the acquisition proceedings ; as soon as it came to know of the acquisition , it had challenged the validity of the acquisition proceedings and , therefore , it furnishes cause of action to the petitioner . He further contends that the writ petition could not be dismissed on the ground of laches but was required to be considered on merits . We find no force in the contention . Any encumbrance created by the erstwhile owner of the land after publication of the notification under Section 4(1 ) does not bind the State if the possession of the land is already taken over after the award came to be passed . The land stood vested in the State free from all encumbrances _ under_Section 16 . In Gunnukh Singh and Ors . v. The State of Haryana JT ( 1995 ) 8 SC 208 , this Court has held that a subsequent purchaser is not entitled to challenge the legality of the acquisition proceedings on the ground of lack of publication of the notification . In Y.N. Garg v. State of Rajasthan [ 1996 ] 1 SCC 284 and SnehPrabha v. State of U.P. [ 1996 ] 7 SCC 325 , this Court had held the alienations made by the erstwhile owner of the land after publication of the notification under Section 4(1 ) , do not bind either_the State Government or the beneficiary for whose benefit the land was acquired . The purchaser does not acquire any valid title . Even the colour of title claimed by the purchaser _ was void . The beneficiary is entitled _ to have absolute possession free from encumbrances . In U.P. Jal Nigam , Lucknow through its Chairman and Anr . v. M / s . Kalra Properties ( P ) Ltd. , Lucknow , and Ors . [ 1996 ] 1 SCC 124 , this Court had further held that the purchaser of the property , after the notification under Section 4(1 ) was published , is devoid of right to challenge the validity of the notification or irregularity in taking possession of the land before publication of the declaration under Section 6 . As regards laches in approaching the Court , this Court has been consistently taking the view starting from State of Madhya Pradesh and Anr . v. Bhailal Bhai and Ors . [ 1964]6SCR261 wherein a Constitution Bench had held that it is not either desirable or expedient to lay down a rule of universal application but the unreasonable delay denies to the petitioner , the discretionary extraordinary remedy                  82
