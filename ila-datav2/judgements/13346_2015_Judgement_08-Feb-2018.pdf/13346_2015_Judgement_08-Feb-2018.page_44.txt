49(a ) . Rule of literal construction lays down that words of a statute are first understood in their natural , ordinary or popular sense and phrases , and sentences are construed according to _ their grammatical meaning . The learned author G.P. Singh , in “ Principles of Statutory Interpretation ” ( 14 edition ) , at Page 91 onwards , has observed : bee eeee Natural and grammatical meaning . The words of a statute are first understood in their natural , ordinary or popular sense and phrases and sentences are construed according to their grammatical meaning , unless that leads to some absurdity or unless there is something in the context , or in the object of the statute to suggest the contrary . “ “ The true way ” , according to LORD BROUGHAM is , “ to take the words _ as_the Legislature have given them , and to take the meaning which the words given naturally imply , unless where the construction of those Words is , either by the preamble or by the context of the words in question , controlled or alter ” ; and in the words of VISCOUNT HALDANE , L.C. , if the language used " has a natural meaning we can not depart from that meaning unless reading the statute as a whole , the context directs us to do so . In an oft - quoted passage , LORD WENSLEYDALE stated the rule thus : " In construing wills and indeed statutes and all written instruments , the grammatical and ordinary sense of the word is adhered to , unless that would lead to some absurdity , or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified , so as to avoid that absurdity , and inconsistency , but no further " . And stated LORD ATKINSON : " In the construction of statutes , their words must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense unless there be something in the context , or in the object of the statute in which they occur or in the circumstances in which they are used , to show that they were used in a special sense different from their ordinary grammatical sense’.28 VISCOUNT SIMON , L.C. , said : “ The golden rule is that the words of a statute must prima facie be given their ordinary meaning ” .                44
