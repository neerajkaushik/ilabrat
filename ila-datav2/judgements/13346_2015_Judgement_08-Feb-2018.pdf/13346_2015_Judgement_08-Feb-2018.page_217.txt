If Section 31 is to be read with Section 34 harmoniously , the same would make it clear that non - deposit or non - payment of compensation will make State liable to pay interest as prescribed . In other words , in case the Collector does not deposit the amount of compensation in Court as contemplated under Section 31(2 ) of the 1894 Act , at the most the persons interested may be entitled to interest of 9 % or 15 % as the case may be . Such act of Collector depositing the amount in the Treasury and such act of Collector in not depositing the amount in Court as mandated in sub - section 2 of Section 31 may not result in extreme consequence of lapsing of acquisition . 18 .
