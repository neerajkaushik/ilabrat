remitted the matter to the High Court to file writ appeal under the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh UchchaNyayalaya ( Khand NyaypeethKo Appeal ) Adhiniyam , 2005 . On 04.04.2007 the High Court again directed maintenance of status quo . The respondent therein filed an application raising the grounds for quashing acquisition proceedings under Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act . It was resisted by the IDA on the ground that the acquisition had been completed and the amount has been deposited with the Land Acquisition Collector ; that the construction is substantially complete ; if it is not completed in the remaining area , it will cause great hardship to the citizens and widening of road was necessary for smooth flow of traffic . The High Court by an order dated 03.11.2014 held that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed in view of the decisions of this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation ( supra ) and Sree Balaji ( supra ) . On appeal to this Court , the matter has been referred to this Bench by an order of 07.12.2017 to consider the Question No . 1 as mentioned in paragraph 1 of this judgment . 4 . It was submitted by the learned counsel for the State that there is a distinction between the words “ payment ” and “ deposit ” , and that the acquisition does not lapse on a failure to “ deposit ” in Court ; this Court in Pune Municipal Corporation ( supra ) did not consider certain Rules framed by various States under Section 55 of the Land Acquisition Act , 1894 which direct the deposit of compensation in the accounts of landowners in the Treasury . 5 . On the other hand , it was contended by the learned counsel for the landowners that a deposit must necessarily be made in Court under Section 31(2 ) of the 1894 Act , 204
