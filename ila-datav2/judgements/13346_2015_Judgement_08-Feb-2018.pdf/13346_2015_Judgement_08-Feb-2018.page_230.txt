The landowners filed writ petitions questioning the acquisition of the lands . The Single Judge dismissed these writ petitions on 14.01.2008 . The High Court held that rehabilitation of displaced persons was a prerequisite to submerging any of the villages in the dam . Thus , such a situation did indeed warrant urgency under Section 17 ( 1 ) ; further , there was an apprehension that the acquisition of land would get delayed by the operation of S. 5A ; that there was clear application of mind to the invocation of the urgency clause . The High Court thus dismissed the writ appeals . Being aggrieved , the landowners appealed to this Court . Pending appeal , the 2013 Act came into force . 42 . A two - judge bench of this Court on 12.01.2016 referred the matter to a larger bench , on the abovementioned Question Nos . 2 and 3 . 43 . On one hand , it was contended by the learned counsel on behalf of the landowners that periodof interim stay could not be excluded from the calculation of the period of five years or more under Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act . The statute is a beneficial legislation . The Court could not supply casus omissus , as the intention of the Legislature in omitting it was evident . While it amended other provisions to exclude stay period , it did not amend Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act . 44 . On the other , it was submitted by the learned counsel on behalf of the State that period of interim stay ought to be excluded from the calculation of five years under Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act . As it was not an intentional omission of the Legislature , the Court could supply meaning to the provision to make it consistent with the rest of the statute . 230
