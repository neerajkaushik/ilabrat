51 . Prior to the 2013 Act , a Coordinate Bench of this Court in Shri Kishan Das & Ors . v. State of U.P. & Ors . , 1995 ( 6 ) SCC 240 , has considered the detrimental impact of stay orders upon the State in a different context , and held that it can not be made to pay interest for a stay order - induced delay in making the award by observing : “ 3 . Shri B.B. Sanyal , learned senior counsel for the appellants , contended that the award was made on 22.3.1983 though the acquisition was made in September 1976 . Therefore , the appellants should be compensated by payment of interest @ 12 per cent per annum . In support of his contention , he placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Ram Chand v. Union of India ( 1994 ) 1 SCC 44 and in particular on paragraph 16 of the judgment . It is seen that in Ram Chander 's case even after the dismissal of the writ petitions by this Court in Aflatoon v. Lt . Governor of Delhi [ ( 1975 ) 4 SCC 285 ] , no action was taken by the Land Acquisition Officer to pass the award . Thus , till 1980 - 81 no award was made in respect of any of the acquisitions . Under these circumstances , this Court had directed the Government to pay interest @ 12 per cent on the amount awarded to compensate the loss caused to the appellants therein . In this case , it is seen that though the notification was issued in September 1976 , the writ petitions came to be filed in the High Court immediately thereafter in 1977 and _ obviously further proceedings were stayed . Accordingly , the Land Acquisition Officer delayed the award . After the dismissal of the writ petitions , the appellants came to this Court and obtained status quo . Obviously , the Land Acquisition Officer was not in a position to pass the award immediately . Thereafter , it would appear that he passed the award on 22.3.1983 . Section 34 of the Act obligates the State to pay interest from the date of taking possession under the unamended Act @ 6 per cent and after the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 at different rates mentioned therein . The liability of the State to pay interest ceases with the deposit made as per Section 34 of the Act . Further liability would arise only when the court on reference under Section 18 enhances the compensation under Section 28 of the Act . Similarly , in an appeal under Section 54 of the Act if the appellate court further increases the compensation , then again similar obligation under Section 28 arises . ” ( emphasis supplied )    Clearly , stay orders by the Court constrain the State from continuing with the acquisition proceedings . It may also lead to consequences of contempt , as in Magnum Promoters ( supra ) . In such a situation , the legal position on the exclusion or inclusion of the period of stay in Section 24(2 ) of the 2013 Act can not be readily inferred to be against the State due to the omission of the Legislature . 237
