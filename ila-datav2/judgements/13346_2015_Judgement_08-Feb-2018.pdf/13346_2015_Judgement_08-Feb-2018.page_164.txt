28 . That no one shall suffer by an act of the court is not a rule confined to an erroneous act of the court ; the ‘ act of the court ’ embraces within its sweep all such acts as to which the court may form an opinion in any legal proceedings that the court would not have so acted had it been correctly apprised of the facts and the law . The factor attracting applicability of restitution is not the act of the Court being wrongful or a mistake or error committed by the Court ; the test is whether on account of an act of the party persuading the Court to pass an order held at the end as not sustainable , has resulted in one party gaining an advantage which it would not have otherwise corned , or the other party has suffered_an _ impoverishment which it would not have suffered but for the order_of the Court and the set of such party .                  The quantum of restitution , depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case , may take into consideration not only what the party excluded would have made but also what the party under obligation has or might reasonably have made .

Whenever called upon to adjudicate , the court would act in conjunction with what is the real and substantial justice . The injury , if any , caused by the act of the court shall be undone and the gain which the party would have earned unless it was interdicted by the order of the court would be restored to or conferred on the party by suitably commanding the party liable to do so . Any opinion to the contrary would lead to unjust if not disastrous consequences . Litigation may turn into a fruitful industry . Though litigation is not gambling yet there is an element _ of chance in every litigation . Unscrupulous litigants may feel encouraged to approach the Courts , persuading the court to pass_interlocutory orders favourable to them by making out a prima facie case when the issues are yet to be heard and determined on merits and if the concept of restitution is excluded from application to interim orders , then the litigant would stand to gain by swallowing the benefits yielding out of the interim order even though the battle has been lost at the end . This can not be countenanced , we are , therefore , or the opinion that the successful party                      164
