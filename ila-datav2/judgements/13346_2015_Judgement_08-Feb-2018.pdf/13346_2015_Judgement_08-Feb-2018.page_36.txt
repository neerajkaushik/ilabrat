X XXXX And , in construing section 14(f ) of the U.P. Town Areas Act , 1914 , which reads ‘ A tax_on persons assessed _ according to their circumstances and property not exceeding such rate and subject_to such limitations and restrictions _ as_may be prescribed ’ , the Supreme Court refused to read residence within the town area _ as a necessary part of the condition for imposition of the said tax . S.K. DAS , J. said , “ To do so will be to read in clause ( f ) words which do not occur there ” .    Further , in interpreting section 6(a ) and section 43 of the Transfer of Property Act , 1882 , the Supreme Court refused to read a further exception in section 43 excluding its operation in cases of transfer of spessuccessionis . VENKATARAMA AIYER , J. quoted with approval the observations of LORD LOREBURN , L.C. , “ We are not entitled to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself ” . X XXXX On the same principle the House of Lords refused to read the word ‘ satisfied ’ in section 4 of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1950 to mean ‘ satisfied beyond reasonable doubt ’ . X XXxx Sections 12(5 ) and 15(5 ) of the Right to Information Act , 2005 , while providing that the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners shall be persons of eminence in public life , with wide knowledge and experience in law , science , and technology , social science , management , journalism , mass media or administration and governance , do not further prescribe any basic qualification which such persons must have in the respective fields in which they work . As a result , the Court can not read into the provisions of sections 12(5 ) and 15(5 ) of the Act the words that such persons must have a basic degree in their respective fields . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 36
