workman dismissed or discharged his one month 's wages . In ( 1962 ) 3 Suppl . S.C.R. 618 ] Strawboard Manufacturing Co. v. Gobind this Court while construing this proviso , observed that when it lays down the condition as to payment of one month 's wages all that the employer is required to do to carry out that condition is to tender the wages to the employee .

Industrial Tribunal , Delhi was a case where the wages were remitted by money order but the workman purposely refused to receive them . It was held that the employer could not be said not to have complied with the condition laid down by the proviso .

This Court observed that the expression " paid " in section 16(2 ) does not contemplate actual receipt of the dividend by the members of the community ; in general , the dividend 31
