119 . In Mohd Gazi v. State of Madhya Pradesh ( 2000 ) 4 SCC 342 this court has laid down thus : “ 6 . In the facts and circumstances of the case the maxim of equity , namely , actus curiae neminem gravabit - an act of the Court shall prejudice no man , shall be applicable . This maxim is founded upon justice and good sense which serves a safe and certain guide for the administration of law . The other maxim is , lex non cogit ad impossibilia - the law does not compel a man to do which he can not possibly perform . The law itself and its administration is understood to disclaim as it does in its general aphorisms , all intention of compelling impossibilities , and the administration of law must adopt that general exception in the consideration of particular cases . The applicability of the aforesaid maxims has been approved by this Court in Raj Kumar Day and Ors . v. Tarapada Day and Ors . [ 1988 ] 1 SCR 118 and Gursharan Singh and Ors . v. NDMC and Ors . [ 1996 ] 1 SCR 1154 . ” 120 . Shri Patwalia has also pressed into service the maxim of Roman Law namely , ‘ Nemo Tenetur ad Impossibilia ’ ( no one is bound to do an impossibility ) . Claimants/ landowners are filing successive applications/ litigations for obtaining interim stay that has been granted . There is no way to make them ready to accept the compensation as once they accept the compensation their right to question the acquisition would stand wiped off . They could not even claim higher compensation in Reference Court , in case they accept the compensation without protest . It is only after accepting the compensation under protest that they can seek reference under section 18 of the Act of 1894 . 140
