29 . The objective of directing a deposit of compensation in Court in the 1894 Actwas to prevent unnecessary prolongation of the proceedings , and accumulation of the Collector â€™s liability to pay interest under Section 34 , when compensation is not paid or deposited on or before taking possession . The landowners can not take advantage of their own act of refusing to receive compensation , and contend that compensation has never been paid to them , when it has actually been deposited in the Treasury . Once the State deposits the money in the Treasury , it has shown its bona fide intention to go through with the acquisition and give the beneficiaries their due compensation . In such a case , it can hardly be punished with a lapse , except that it is liable to pay interest as prescribed under the Act . Moreover , as discussed in the preceding paragraph , practical considerations make it clear that the Collector may not be able to individually reach out to thousands of claimants and pay them the compensation in person at the earliest . It is only reasonable that the Collector be allowed to deposit the compensation in the accounts of individual claimants in the Treasury , and to inform the claimants to get the same released . 30 . | am thus of the opinion that from both a legal and a practical standpoint , a deposit in the accounts of individual landowners in the Treasury , and informing them about such deposit for getting the same released in their favour where they do not appear to accept compensation as under the State Rules , does not result in the lapse of acquisition proceedings . 31 .
