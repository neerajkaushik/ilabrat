145(j ) . In Delhi Development Authority v. Sukhbir Singh & Ors . ( 2016 ) 16 SCC 258 , Pune Municipal Corpn . ( supra ) has been followed and deposit in treasury has been held , referable to section 31(1 ) of the Act of 1894 and not under section 31(2 ) . We agree with discussion made with respect to section 31(1 ) . In view of the discussion made with respect to the expressions “ paid ” and “ tendered ” the decision of Pune Municipal Corpn . ( supra ) can not be said to be laying down the correct law . It suffers to that extent from the same malady as it has simply followed Pune Municipal Corpn . ( supra ) . In State of Haryana & Anr . v. Devander Sagar & Ors . ( 2016 ) 14 SCC 746 , this Court has held that the compensation had been paid ; HUDA had taken possession . As per requirement of section 24 , award was also passed . The acquisition had been allowed to become final . Thus challenge to acquisition under the Act of 2013 was repelled . 145(k ) . In Aligarh Development Authority v. Megh Singh & Ors . ( 2016 ) 12 SCC 504 , the award was not passed when the Act of 2013 came into force . Thus , it was rightly held by this Court that the acquisition proceedings would continue but with a rider that the award will have to be passed and compensation determined under 182
