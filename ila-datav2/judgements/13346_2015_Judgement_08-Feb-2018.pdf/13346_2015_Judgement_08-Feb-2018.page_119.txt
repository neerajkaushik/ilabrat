“ 9 . Therefore , the reason given in B.R. Gupta v. U.O.I. and Ors . 37(1989 ) DLT 150 are obvious with reference to the quashing of the publication of the declaration under Section 6 vis - a - vis the writ petitioners therein . The question thus arise for consideration is : whether the stay obtained by some of the persons who prohibited the respondents from publication of the declaration under Section 6 would equally be extendible to the cases relating to the appellants ? We proceed on the premise that the appellants had not obtained any stay of the publication of the declaration but since the High Court in some of the cases has , in fact , prohibited them as extracted hereinbefore , from publication of the declaration , necessarily , when the Court has not restricted the declaration in the impugned orders in support of the petitioners therein , the officers had to hold back their hands till the matters are disposed of . In fact , this Court has given extended meaning to the orders of stay or proceeding in various cases , namely , Yusufbhai Noormohmed Nendoliya v. State of Gujarat and Anr . AIR1991SC2153;Hansraj Jain v. State of Maharashtra and Ors . ( 1993 ) 4 JT 360 ; Sangappa Gurulingappa Sajjan v. State of Kamataka and Ors . ( 1994 ) 4 SCC 145 ; Gandhi Grah Nirman Sahkari Samiti Ltd. Etc . Etc . v. State of Rajasthan and Ors . JT(1993 ) 3 194 ; G. Narayanaswamy Reddy ( dead ) by Lrs . and Anr . v. Govt . of Karnataka and Anr . JT ( 1991 ) 312 and Roshnara Begum Etc . v. U.O.L. and Ors.(1986 ) 1 apex Dec 6.The words " stay of the action or proceeding " have been widely interpreted by this Court and mean that any type of the orders passed by this Court would be an inhibitive action on the part of the authorities to proceed further . When the action of conducting an enquiry under Section 5-A was put in issue and the declaration under Section 6 was questioned , necessarily unless the Court holds that enquiry under Section 5-A was properly conducted and the declaration published under Section 6 to be valid , it would not be open to the officers to proceed further into the matter . As a consequence , the stay granted in respect of some would be applicable to others also who had not obtained stay in that behalf . We are not concerned with the correctness of the earlier direction with regard to Section 5-A enquiry and consideration of objections as it was not challenged by the respondent union . We express no opinion on its correctness , though it is open to doubt . ”        ( emphasis supplied ) 119
