The expression “ paid ” would mean in section 31(1 ) of Act 1894 and section 24(2 ) of Act of 2013 as soon as it is offered and made unconditionally available . Merely , if a landowner refuses to accept it , it can not be said that it has not been paid . Once amount has been tendered that would amount to payment . Thus , word “ paid ” does not mean actual payment to be made but whatever is possible for an incumbent to make the payment is only contemplated . “ Paid ” does not mean receipt or deposited in Court . There may be refusal to receive an amount in spite of its tender . Thus , in view of the decisions of this court in CIT Kerala ( supra ) , N.B. Sanjana ( supra ) and J. Dalmia ( supra ) , the provisions of section 24(2 ) have to be construed to mean tender of amount would mean payment as envisaged . 40 . It is settled that a Court can not add or subtract a word ; the expression “ compensation has not been paid ” is used in section 24(2 ) ; it is not open to the court to add to these words , or to substitute the said expression with any further expression , such as ‘ deposit ’ .
