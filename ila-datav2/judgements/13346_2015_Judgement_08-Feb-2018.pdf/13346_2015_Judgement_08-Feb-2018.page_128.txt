In the provisions contained in section 19 of the Act of 2013 there is prescription of the period of limitation in which a declaration has to be issued , it was equivalent to section 6 of the Act of 1894 , as such the provision of exclusion has been made alike the previous provision , so also in section 69 . Section 24 as couched did not contemplate providing cover to the litigation and its fruits to be reaped . The absence of provision for excluding the period of stay/ injunction of a Court order does not at all affect the provision of section 24(2 ) of the Act of 2013 . It intended that authority should not keep pending acquisition due to laxity on their part for five years or more . It never intended to apply in case they were not able to perform obligation due to court order or conduct of landowners . Obviously the legal provisions have to be interpreted in the light of the settled principles of common law unless they are excluded , and in case a person is litigating for several decades , non - acceptance of compensation and questioning 128
