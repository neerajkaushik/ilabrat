99 . Section 24 is not intended to come to the aid of those who first deliberately refuse to accept the compensation , and then indulge in ill - advised litigation , and often ill - motivated dilatory tactics , for decades together . On the contrary , the section is intended to help those who have not been offered or paid the compensation despite it being the legal obligation of the acquiring body so to do , and/or who have been illegally deprived of their possession for five years or more ; in both the scenarios , fault / cause not being attributable to the landowners / claimants . 100 . We are of the view that stale or dead claims can not be the subject - matter of judicial probing under section 24 of the Act of 2013 . The provisions of section 24 do not invalidate those judgment / orders of the courts where under rights / claims have been lost / negatived , neither do they revive those rights which have come barred , either due to inaction or otherwise by operation of law . Fraudulent and stale claims are not at all to be raised under the guise of section 24 . Misuse of provisions of section 24(2 ) can not be permitted . Protection by the courts in cases of such blatant misuse of the provisions of law could never have been the intention behind 113
