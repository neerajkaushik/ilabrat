finally held entitled to a relief assessable in terms of money at the end of the litigation , is entitled to be compensated by award of interest at a suitable reasonable rate for the period for which the interim order of the court withholding the release of money had remained in operation . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 140(b ) . The doctrine of restitution in common law principle lies in conscience of court , it had also been discussed in State of Gujarat v. Essar Oil Ltd. , ( 2012 ) 3 SCC 522 ; it was held that : “ 61 . The concept of restitution is virtually a common law principle and it is a remedy against unjust enrichment _ or unjust benefit . The core of the concept lies in the conscience of the Court which prevents a party from retaining money or some benefit derived from another which he has received by way of an erroneous decree of Court . Such remedy in English Law is generally different from a remedy in contract or in tort and falls within a third category of common law remedy which is called quasi - contract or restitution .          62 . If we analyze the concept of restitution one thing emerges clearly that the obligation to restitute lies on the person or the authority that has received unjust enrichment or unjust benefit ( See Halsbury 's Laws of England , Fourth Edition , Volume 9 , page 434 ) .    63 . If we look at Restatement of the Law of Restitution by American Law Institute ( 1937 American Law Institute Publishers , St. Paul ) we get that a person is enriched if he has received a benefit and similarly a person is unjustly enriched if the retention of the benefit would be unjust . Now the question is what constitutes a benefit . A person confers benefit upon another if he gives to the other possession of or some other interest in money , land , chattels , or performs services beneficial to or at the request of the other , satisfies a debt or a duty of the other or in a way adds to the other 's security or advantage . He confers a benefit not only where he adds to the property of another but also where he saves the other from expense or loss . Thus the word " benefit " therefore denotes any form of advantage ( page 12 of the Restatement of the Law of Restitution by American Law Institute ) . 165
