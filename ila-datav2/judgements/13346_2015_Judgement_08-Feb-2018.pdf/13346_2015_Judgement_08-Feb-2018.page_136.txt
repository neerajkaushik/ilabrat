not at all . This rule flows from the maxim : " Expressio unius est exclusion alterius . " But , as we pointed out by Wills , J. , in Colquohoun v. Brooks ( 1888 ) 2 1 . Q.B. D. 52 this maxim " is often a valuable servant , but a dangerous master .... " The rule is subservient to the basic principle that Courts must endeavour to ascertain the legislative intent and purpose , and then adopt a rule of construction which effectuates rather than one that may defeat these . Moreover the rule of prohibition by necessary implication could be applied only where a specified procedure is laid down for the performance of a duty . Although Rule 52 makes an assessment obligatory before goods are removed by a manufacturer , yet , neither that rule nor any other , rule , as already indicated above , has specified the detailed procedure for an assessment . There is no express prohibition anywhere against an assessment at any other time in the circumstances of a case like the one before us where no " assessment " , as it is understood in Jaw , took place at all . On the other hand , Rule 10A indicates that there are residuary powers of making a demand in special circumstances not foreseen by the framers of the Act or the rules . If the assessee disputes the correctness of the demand an assessment becomes necessary to protect the interests of the assessee . A case like the one before us falls more properly within the residuary class of unforeseen cases . We think that , from the provisions of Section 4 of the Act read with Rule 10A , an implied power to carry out or complete an assessment , not specifically provided for by the rules , can be inferred . No writs of prohibition or mandamus were , therefore , called for in the circumstances of the case . ‚Äù          Thus , the Common Law principles , as discussed by us , can not be ousted , to do complete justice to parties and to prevent miscarriage of justice , within purview of section 24 of the Act of DOCTRINE OF IMPOSSIBILITY    117 . In several cases it is often seen that the landowners are not 136
