Law held by a tenure subject to no contingency ; complete ; established by law as a permanent right ; vested interest . " ( See Mosammat Bibi Sayeeda and Ors . etc . v. State of Bihar and Ors . etc . AIR 1996 SC 1936 at SCC p.527 , para 17 ) 21 . The word " vest " is normally used where an immediate fixed right in present or future enjoyment in respect of a property is created . With the long usage , the said word " vest " has also acquired a meaning as " an absolute or indefeasible right " . It had a " legitimate " or " settled expectation " to obtain right to enjoy the property etc . Such " settled expectation " can be rendered impossible of fulfillment due to change in law by the Legislature . Besides this , such a " settled expectation " or the so - called " vested right " can not be countenanced against public interest and convenience which are sought to be served by amendment of the law . ( Vide : Howrah Municipal Corpn . and Ors . v. Ganges Rope Co. Ltd. and Ors . ( 2004 ) 1 SCC 663 . 22 . Thus , " vested right " is a right independent of any contingency . Such a right can arise from a contract , statute or by operation of law . A vested right can be taken away only if the law specifically or by necessary implication provide for such a course . ‚Äù 82 . On proper reading of section 24 , it is clear that no divesting is contemplated under the provision . Provisions of section 24 when award is passed , possession is taken , compensation has been tendered , vesting takes place . There is no deemed lapse under section 24 in such a case . In case of urgency also before award is passed as provided in section 17(1 ) , 17(3A ) vesting takes place on fulfillment of conditions . 88
