2008 . The High Court has quashed the acquisition proceedings and has directed restoration of the possession . When the High Court has quashed the acquisition , there was no room for this court to entertain the submissions based upon section 24(2 ) of the Act of 2013 . There was no question of payment of compensation to the owners or depositing it in the court as land acquisition itself had been quashed in 2008 . There was no subsisting acquisition and award . When Act of 2013 came into force thus no question could have been raised as to non - compliance with section 24 for five years or more . Thus , there was no question of taking possession or payment of compensation as per provisions contained in section 24(2 ) . The provisions contained in section 24 could not be said to be applicable after quashing / lapse of the proceedings . Thus , when the provisions of section 24 were not attracted to the fact situation of the case in Pune Municipal Corporation ( supra ) , the decision can not be said to be an authority on a question which , in fact , did not arise for consideration of this court . Thus , the decision rendered on a question which was not germane to the case can not be said to be a binding precedent it is obiter dicta and thus has to be ignored . 189
