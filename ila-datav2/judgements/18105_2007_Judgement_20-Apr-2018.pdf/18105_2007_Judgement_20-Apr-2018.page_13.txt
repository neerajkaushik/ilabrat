17 . Undisputedly , the lease of the land was entered into between the parties prior to the 1950 Act coming into force . The Act of 1950 is not applicable to the land which was being used for non agricultural purposes prior to 1950 . Land as defined in Section 3 ( 14 ) of the 1950 Act means land , held or occupied for purposes connected with agriculture , horticulture or animal husbandry . Moreover , there is also a declaration under Section 143 of the 1950 Act that the land was being used for non agricultural purposes . The said order under Section 143 passed by the SDO , Bijnor on 20.01.1972 was on the basis of a report submitted by the Tehsildar made on 17.12.1970 . In view of the above , we are of the opinion that the land did not vest in the Government under the 1950 Act . .We are not in agreement with the findings of the High Court regarding the vesting of the land in the Government under the 1950 Act due to which the Plaintiffs were held disentitled for any compensation . The land owners may resort to any remedy available to them for payment of compensation to which they are entitled to .
