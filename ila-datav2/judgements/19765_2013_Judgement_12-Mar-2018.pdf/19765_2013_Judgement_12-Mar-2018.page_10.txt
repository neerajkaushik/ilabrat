24 ) In view of the foregoing discussion , the appeals succeed and are accordingly allowed . The impugned orders are set aside and the writ petition is remanded to the Division Bench for its decision afresh on merits in accordance with law . 25 ) We , however , make it clear that having formed an opinion to remand the case to the Division Bench , we did not apply our mind to the merits of the controversy . We , therefore , request the High Court ( Division Bench ) to decide the writ petition in accordance with law preferably within six months uninfluenced by any of our observations . eessusestssesesvsvsvsesesessessteceeesees di [ R.K.
