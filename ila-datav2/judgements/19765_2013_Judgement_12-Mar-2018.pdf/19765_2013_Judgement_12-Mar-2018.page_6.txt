Single Judge of this Court in the decision reported in 1994 Writ L.R. 764 ( Seethalakshmi / Ramakrishnanda vs. Special Tahsildear ( LA ) II , Bharathiyar University , Coimbatore and another ) and _ without considering the question as to whether the case of the writ petitioners , was similar to the one reported in 1994 Writ L.R. 764 ( supra ) , merely allowed the writ petition based on the submission made by the learned counsel appearing for the respective parties . 5 . In the facts and circumstances , as contended by the learned counsel appearing for the appellant - State , the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge , can be held to be not a reasoned order , erroneous and not sustainable in the eye of law . We accordingly set aside the impugned order passed by the learned Single Judge . ” 15 ) Second , in the light of afore - mentioned findings , the Division Bench should have either dealt with all the issues raised by the parties and given its own reasoning on all such issues while deciding the appeal or remanded the case to the writ Court ( Single Judge ) for deciding the appellants ’ writ petition afresh on merits and to pass a reasoned order dealing with all the grounds raised by the parties in support of their respective contentions .
