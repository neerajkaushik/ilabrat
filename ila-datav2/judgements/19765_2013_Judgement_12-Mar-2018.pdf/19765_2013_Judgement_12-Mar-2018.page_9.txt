wherein all the issues raised by the parties are open for examination by the Appellate Court 21 ) A fortiori , what was not decided in appeal by the Division Bench could not be decided by the Division Bench while deciding the review application . It is for this reason , we are also constrained to set aside the review order . 22 ) In the light of foregoing discussion , we are of the view that the orders passed by the High Court , i.e. , ( writ Court and Division Bench ) are bad in law and can not be legally sustained for want of any reason , discussion and finding on any of the grounds / issues raised by the parties in support of their respective contentions . 23 ) Since the matter is pending for the last three decades , we consider it just and proper to remand the case ( writ petition ) to the Division Bench for its decision afresh on merits in accordance with law instead of remanding it to the Writ Court .
