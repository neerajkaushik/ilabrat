CRIMINAL APPEAL NO . 597 OF 2018 Notice was issued to the respondents . Respondent No . 1 / State of Kerala as well as official respondent Nos . 2 and 3 , viz . , the Superintendent of Police and Sub - inspector of Police , have put in their appearance through the State counsel . Nobody has appeared on behalf of respondent No . 4 in spite of service of notice . In the aforesaid circumstances , we have heard learned counsel for ’ the appellants as well as learned counsel for the State . A neat submission which is made by the learned counsel for the appellants is that the High Court has adopted an approach which is not permissible in law by going into the validity of marriage . It is submitted that when Thushara is admittedly a major i.e. , more than 18 years of age , she has right to live wherever she wants to or move as per her choice . As she is not a minor daughter of respondent No . 4 , “ custody ” of Thushara could not be entrusted to him . Learned counsel for the appellants is right in his submission . Even the counsel for the State did not dispute the aforesaid position in law and , in fact , supported this submission of the learned counsel for the appellants .

Appellant No . 1 as well as Thushara are Hindus . Such a
