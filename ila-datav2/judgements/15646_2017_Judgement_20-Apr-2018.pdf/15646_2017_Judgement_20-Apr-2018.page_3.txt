CRIMINAL APPEAL NO . 597 OF 2018 30.05.1997 , and in support thereof , produced driving licence issued by the licensing authorities . Treating it to be the date of birth of appellant No . 1 , the High Court found that he would be attaining the age of 21 years only on 30.05.2018 . Therefore , on 12.04.2017 , when the marriage was solemnised between appellant No . 1 and Thushara , appellant No . 1 was not of marriageable age . On that basis , the High Court concluded that the daughter of respondent No . 4 is not the lawfully wedded wife of appellant No . 1 . The High Court also remarked that apart from the photographs of marriage which were produced in the High Court , there was no evidence to show that a valid marriage was solemnised between the parties and that a certificate issued by the local authority under the Kerala Registration of Marriages ( Common ) Rules , 2008 , was also not produced . On these facts , the High Court allowed the writ petition by entrusting the custody of Thushara to her father i.e. , respondent No . 4 herein , as is clear from the following directions contained in the impugned order : “ We accordingly dispose of the writ petition by entrusting custody of Ms. Thushara , the daughter of the petitioner with the petitioner . The Sub Inspector of Police , Vattiyoorkavu shall , to ensure their safety accompany them to their residence at Thirvananthapuram . ” Assailing the aforesaid order , the present appeal is preferred .
