examination of any witness until any other witness or witnesses have been examined . Section 231(2 ) of the Cr . P.C. does not confer a right on the accused to seek deferral in a wholesale way on the ground that the defence of the accused would become known to the Prosecution . The deferral of cross - examination , in the present case , would run counter to the general provisions of the Indian Evidence Act , 1872 . The Additional Sessions Judge held that the deferral of crossexamination in this case could give rise to the possibility of loss of memory on the part of the witnesses , who had already been examined - in - chief , which would adversely affect the case of the Prosecution . The Additional Sessions Judge also observed that no specific reason for deferring the cross - examination had been pleaded on behalf of the Respondent - Accused No . 2 , apart from a general averment that the defence would be disclosed to the Prosecution . The Additional Sessions Judge was of the view that the Respondent - Accused No . 2 and Accused No . 7 are “ highly influential political leaders ” , and the possibility of the threats to witnesses after their examination - in - chief , could not be ruled out . Furthermore , it was observed that CWs 1 to 5 would be deposing on different facts and aspects of the case .
