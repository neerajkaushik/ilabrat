14 . The impugned Order is liable to be set aside since the High Court has given no reasons for reversal of the Order of the Additional Sessions Judge , particularly in light of the possibility of undue influence and intimidation of witness(es ) since the Respondent - Accused No . 2 and Accused No . 7 are “ highly influential political leaders ” . In view of the aforesaid discussion , the present Criminal Appeal is allowed , and the impugned Order dated January 9 , 2018 passed by the High Court of Kerala in Criminal Miscellaneous Case No . 171 of 2018 is set aside . The Order dated December 20 , 2017 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge dismissing the Application filed on behalf of the Respondent - Accused No . 2 stands restored . The observations made hereinabove will , however , have no bearing on the merits of the case during the course of trial . Ordered accordingly . SaUS SUSSMAN REN NEN SAA UNU ERASE J.
