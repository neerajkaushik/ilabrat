It was observed that if a member of Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes gets the benefit of that status throughout the territory of India , the expression " in relation to that State ” would become nugatory . If the special privileges or the rights granted to scheduled castes or scheduled tribes in a particular State are to be made available in all the States and if such benefits are to be carried from State ‘ A ’ to State ‘ B ’ on migration , the mandate of Article 341/342 would get compromised . Such a consequence must be avoided for it is a fundamental rule of interpretation , be it of a statutory enactment or of the Constitution , that wherever and whenever there is a conflict between two provisions , the same should be so interpreted as to give effect to both . beeeees Nothing is surplus in a Constitution and no part should be made nugatory ..... ” .
