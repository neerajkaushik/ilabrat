circumstances , the assertion made by the appellants that pressure was exerted through the police and they were compelled to enter into compromise is prima facie acceptable . In Ajad Singh v. Chatra and Others ‘ , compromise recorded in Police Station inter alia was not found to be acceptable by this Court and the matter was remanded . It was observed , “ .... the appellate court ought to have taken note of the fact that the said compromise was recorded in the Police Station and during the pendency of the suit . ” It is true that there was a delay of 604 days in filing the appeal , but in cases where there is reasonable doubt that police may have forced a party to enter into compromise , the process of Court ought to weigh in favour of a party who alleges to be victim of such pressure . It may be pertinent to note that the order passed by the High Court does not even deal with this aspect nor was any submission made that the assessment made by the appellate court was in any way incorrect or imperfect . 11 .

Said Sections are as under : 1 ( 2005 ) 2 SCC 567 ( para 8)
