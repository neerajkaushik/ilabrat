The facts therein were as follows : “ The tenant and the son of the landlord referred the disputes between them to arbitration . The landlord was not a party to this agreement . The arbitrators passed an award whereunder the tenant was to give vacant possession of the premises in favour of the landlord within a particular time . This award was made a decree of court . The landlord , who was neither a party to the award nor to the proceedings , which resulted in the award being made a decree of court , applied for eviction of the tenant on the basis of the award . The tenant resisted execution by raising various objections under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure . One of the objections was that the decree for eviction based upon the award was a nullity as being opposed to the Delhi and Ajmer Rent Control Act , 1952 . This Court held that the decree directing the tenant to deliver possession of the premises to the landlord was a nullity , as it was passed in contravention of Section 13(1 ) of the relevant statute . After quoting the sub - section , this Court further held that the decree for eviction passed according to an award , in a proceeding to which the landlord was not a party and without the court satisfying itself that a statutory ground of eviction existed , was a nullity and can not be enforced 2 ( 1973 ) 1 SCC 761 3 ( 1969 ) 2 SCR 432
