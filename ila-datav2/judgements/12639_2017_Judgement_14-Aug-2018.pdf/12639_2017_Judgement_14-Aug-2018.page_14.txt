14 provisions of Section 13 , held that a decree for recovery of possession can be passed only if the court concerned is satisfied that one or other of the grounds mentioned in the section is established . This Court , further observed : “ From the facts mentioned earlier , it is seen that at no stage , the Court was called upon to apply its mind to the question whether the alleged subletting is true or not . Order made by it does not show that it was satisfied that the subletting complained of has taken place , nor is there any other material on record to show that it was so satisfied . It is clear from the record that the court had proceeded solely on the basis of the compromise arrived at between the parties . That being so there can be hardly any doubt that the court was not competent to pass the impugned decree . Hence the decree under execution must be held to be a nullity . ” 13 . In Nagindas Ramdas v. Dalpatram Ichharam alias Brijram and Others ® it was stated : “ 17 . It will thus be seen that the Delhi Rent Act and the Madras Rent Act expressly forbid the Rent Court or the Tribunal from passing a decree or order of eviction on a ground which is not any of the grounds mentioned in the relevant Sections of those statutes . Nevertheless , such a prohibitory mandate to the Rent Court that it shall not travel beyond the statutory grounds mentioned in Sections 12 and 13 , and to the parties that they shall not contract out of those statutory grounds , is inherent in the public policy built into the statute ( Bombay Rent Act ) . 6 ( 1974 ) 1 SCC 242
