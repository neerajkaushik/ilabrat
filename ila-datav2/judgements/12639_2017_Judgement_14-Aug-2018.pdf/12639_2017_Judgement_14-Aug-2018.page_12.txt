in execution . It will be seen from this decision that the decree was held to be a nullity because the landlord was not a party thereto , and also because the court had not satisfied itself that a ground for eviction , as required by the statute , existed . This decision is certainly an authority for the proposition that a court ordering eviction has to satisfy itself that a statutory ground of eviction has been made out by a landlord . How exactly that satisfaction is to be expressed by the court or gathered from the materials , has not been laid down in this decision , as this court was not faced with such a problem . ” 21 . In Kaushalya Devi v. Shri K.L. Bansal ‘ the question again rose under the same Delhi statute regarding the validity of a decree passed for eviction on compromise . The plaintiff therein filed a suit for eviction of the tenant on two grounds — ( a ) the premises were required for their own use ; and ( b)the tenant had committed default in payment of rent . 22 . The tenant filed a written statement denying both these allegations . He disputed the claim of the landlord regarding his requiring the premises for his own use bona fide and also the fact of his being in arrears . When the pleadings of the landlord and the tenant were in this state , both parties filed a compromise memo in and by which they agreed to the passing of a decree of eviction against the tenant . Representations to the same effect were also made by the counsel for both parties . The court passed the following order : “ In view of the statement of the parties ’ counsel and the written compromise , a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant . ” The tenant did not vacate the premises within the time mentioned as per the compromise memo .
