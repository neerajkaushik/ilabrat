In Hat Singh ’s ? case this Court discussed the doctrine of double jeopardy and Section 26 of the General Clauses Act to observe that prosecution under two different Acts is permissible if the ingredients of the provisions are satisfied on the same facts . While considering a dispute about the prosecution of the Respondent therein for offences under the Mines and Minerals ( Development and Regulation ) Act 1957 and Indian Penal Code , this Court in State ( NCT of Delhi ) v.

Hat Singh ( 2003 ) 2 SCC 152 4 ( 2014 ) 9 SCC 772 7
