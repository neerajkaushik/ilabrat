17 enumerated above , clearly shows that there was no promise held out to these appellants that after the completion of continuous service of 10 years as Sailors , they would be drafted into Fleet Reserve .

Therefore , even prior to the promulgation of policy for discontinuance of drafting into Fleet Reserve from 1976 , Respondent Nos . 1 and 2 were clearly at liberty to decide if a Sailor is to be enrolled into Fleet Reserve or not . It may be pertinent to mention that the aforesaid view of ours has not been taken for the first time . We are not treading on unchartered territory .

That condition in the appointment letter can not be read in isolation . The governing working conditions of Sailors must be traced to the provisions in the 1957 Act or the Regulations framed thereunder concerning service ( 2017 ) 4 SCC 218
