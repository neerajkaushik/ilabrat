State of Ajmer [ AIR 1955 SC 25 ] , this Court has held that there is no difference between an “ existing law ” and a “ law in force ” . 81 . Applying the tests enumerated hereinabove , we hold that the Kerala Chitties Act , 1975 became void on the making of the Chit Funds Act , 1982 on 19 - 8 - 1982 , [ when it received the assent of the President and got published in the Official Gazette ] as the Central 1982 Act intended to cover the entire field with regard to the conduct of the chits and further that the State Finance Act 7 of 2002 , introducing Section 4(1)(a ) into the State 1975 Act , was void as the State Legislature was denuded of its authority to enact the said Finance Act 7 of 2002 , except under Article 254(2 ) , after the 26
