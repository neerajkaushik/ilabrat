corporate debtor , and that , therefore , the moratorium imposed under Section 14 should apply to the personal guarantor as well . 6 . Shri Sanjay Kapur , learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant in C.A. No . 3595 of 2018 , and Shri C.U. Singh , learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of Appellant in C.A. No . 4553 of 2018 , both argued that the corporate debtor and personal guarantor are separate entities and that a corporate debtor undergoing insolvency proceedings under the Code would not mean that a personal guarantor is also undergoing the same process . As the guarantor â€™s liability is distinct and separate from that of the corporate debtor , a suit can be maintained against the surety , though the principal debtor has not been sued . For this purpose , they relied upon Section 128 of the Indian Contract Act , 1872 . They also relied heavily upon the reasoning contained in a judgment by a Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in Mis . Sicom Investments and Finance Ltd. v. Rajesh Kumar Drolia and Anr . * They then referred to Part III of the Code , and in particular , to Sections 96 and 101 . Although Part III of the Code has not been brought into force , it is clear that if an insolvency resolution process is to be carried out against a personal guarantor , it can be done only under Part 1 ( 2017 ) SCC Online Bom 9725 ( decided on 28.11.2017 ) .
