and several [ Bank of Bihar v. Damodar Prasad , AIR 1969 SC 297 ] . The Committee noted that this characteristic of such contracts i.e. of having remedy against both the surety and the corporate debtor , without the obligation to exhaust the remedy against one of the parties before proceeding against the other , is of utmost important for the creditor and is the hallmark of a guarantee contract , and the availability of such remedy is in most cases the basis on which the loan may have been extended . 5.10 The Committee further noted that a literal interpretation of Section 14 is prudent , and a broader interpretation may not be necessary in the above context . The assets of the surety are separate from those of the corporate debtor , and proceedings against the corporate debtor may not be seriously impacted by the actions against assets of third parties like sureties . Additionally , enforcement of guarantee may not have a significant impact on the debt of the corporate debtor as the right of the creditor against the principal debtor is merely shifted to the surety , to the extent of payment by the surety . Thus , contractual principles of guarantee require being respected even during a moratorium and an _ alternate interpretation may not have been the intention of the Code , as is clear from a plain reading of Section 14 . 5.11 Further , since many guarantees for loans of corporates are given by its promoters in the form of personal guarantees , if there is a stay on actions against their assets during a CIRP , such promoters ( who are also corporate applicants ) may file frivolous applications to merely take advantage of the stay and guard their assets . In the judgments analysed in this relation , many have been filed by the corporate applicant under Section 10 of the Code and this may corroborate the above apprehension of abuse of the moratorium provision . 37
