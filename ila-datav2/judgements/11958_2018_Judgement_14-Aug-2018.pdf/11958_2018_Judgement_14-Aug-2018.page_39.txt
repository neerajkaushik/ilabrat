two parts , one part may be declaratory but the other part may not be so . Therefore , merely because one part of the proviso has been held to be declaratory it does not follow that the second part of the proviso is also declaratory . However , the view that we have taken supports the stand of the Revenue that proviso ( b ) to Section 240 is also declaratory . We have held that even under the unamended Section 240 of the Act , the assessee was only entitled to the refund of tax paid in excess of the tax chargeable on the total income returned by the assessee . We have held so without taking the aid of the amended provision . It , therefore , follows that proviso ( b ) to Section 240 is also declaratory . It seeks to clarify the law so as to remove doubts leading to the courts giving conflicting decisions , and in several cases directing the Revenue to refund the entire amount of income tax paid by the assessee where the Revenue was not in a position to frame a fresh assessment . Being clarificatory in nature it must be held to be retrospective , in the facts and circumstances of the case . It is well settled that the legislature may pass a declaratory Act to set aside what the legislature deems to have been a judicial error in the interpretation of statute . It only seeks to clear the meaning of a provision of the principal Act and make explicit that which was already implicit . ” CIT v. Vatika Township , ( 2015 ) 1 SCC 1 : “ 32 .
