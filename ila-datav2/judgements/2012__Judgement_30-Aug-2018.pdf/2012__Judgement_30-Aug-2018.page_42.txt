42 of the Constitution . 41 . The subject finds an elaborate study by Dr. D.D. Basu in “ Commentary on the Constitution of India”' ® . According to Dr. D.D. Basu , “ In India though the Union and the States have their own public services , ( vide Entry 70 of List I and Entry 41 of List I ) there is no clear - cut bifurcation in the administration of the Union and the State laws as in the U.S.A. The State officials administer the State laws as well the Union laws applicable within that Sate whereas the members of the Union Services while working within a State , also carry out State laws , insofar as they may be applicable . The second peculiarity of the Indian federal system of administration is that though the federal and State Governments have civil services of their own to manage their own households , there are certain services known as the All - India Services , which are common to both the federal and State Governments . 10 8 t * Edition , 2011 , Volume 9 , Page 9858
