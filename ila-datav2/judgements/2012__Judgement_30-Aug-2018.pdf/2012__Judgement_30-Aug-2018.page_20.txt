Bhaiya Lal ( supra ) , this Court held as under : " 10 ... The object of Article 341(1 ) plainly is to provide additional protection to the members of the Scheduled Castes having regard to the economic and educational backwardness from which they suffer . It is obvious that in specifying castes , races or tribes , the President has been expressly authorised to limit the notification to parts of or groups within the castes , races or tribes , and that must mean that after examining the educational and social backwardness of a caste , race or tribe , the President may well come to the conclusion that not the whole caste , race or tribe but parts of or groups within them should be specified . Similarly , the President can specify castes , races or tribes or parts thereof in relation not only to the entire State , but in relation to parts of the State where he is satisfied that the examination of the social and educational are backwardness of the race , caste or tribe justifies such specification . In fact , it is well known that before a notification is issued under Article 341(1 ) , an elaborate enquiry is made and it is as a result of this enquiry that social justice is sought to be done to the castes , races or tribes as may appear to be necessary , and in doing justice , it would obviously be expedient not only to speci arts or groups of castes , races or tribes , but to make the said specification by reference to different areas__in the State . Educational and _ _ social backwardness in regard to these castes , races or tribes may not be uniform or of the same intensity in the whole of the State ; it may vary in degree or in kind in different areas and that may justify the division of the State into convenient and suitable areas for the purpose__of issuing the public notification in question ...
