23 Other Backward Classes ( OBCs ) in the States / Union Territories where they have migrated . The relevant portion of the judgment that may be noticed is as hereunder : " 6 . Castes or groups are specified in relation to a given State or Union Territory , which obviously means that such caste would include caste belonging to an OBC group in relation to that State or Union Territory for which it is specified . The matters that are to be taken into consideration for specifying a particular caste in a particular group belonging to OBCs would depend on the nature and extent of disadvantages and social hardships suffered by that caste or group in that State . However , it may not be so in another State to which a person belonging thereto goes by migration . It may also be that a caste belonging to the same nomenclature is specified in two States but the considerations on the basis of which they had been specified may be totally different . So the degree of disadvantages of various elements which constitute the data for specification may also be entirely different . Thus , merely because a given caste is specified in one State as belonging to OBCs does not necessarily mean that if there be another group belonging to the same nomenclature in another State , a person belonging to that group is entitled to the rights , privileges and benefits admissible to the members of that caste . These aspects have to be borne in mind in interpreting the provisions of the Constitution with reference to application of reservation to OBCs . " 23 .
