In Bhaiya Lal ( supra ) , this Court held that before issuing notifications under Articles 341 and 342 , an elaborate enquiry is made and as a result of the enquiry social justice is sought to be done to the castes , races or tribes as may appear to be necessary . It was further held that only Parliament is empowered to amend the Notification under Articles 341(2 ) and 342(2 ) of the Constitution , as is underlined by the expression “ but save as aforesaid a notification issued under the said clause shall not be varied by any subsequent notification ” occurring in each of the said provisions .
