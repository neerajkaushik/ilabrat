be bound by the decision of the three judge Bench of this Court in S. Pushpa ( supra ) . While doing so , the Delhi High court in paragraph 66 of the judgment emphasised on the necessity of an authoritative pronouncement on the issue(s ) arising . Accordingly , certificate to appeal under Article 134-A of the Constitution was granted by the High Court . Paragraph 66 of the judgment of the Full Bench of the Delhi High Court will require a specific notice and is , therefore , reproduced below : â€œ 66 . This court summarizes its conclusions , as follows : ( 1 ) The decisions in Marri , Action Committee , Milind and Channaiah have all ruled that scheduled caste and tribe citizens moving from one State to another can not claim reservation benefits , whether or not their caste is notified in the state where they migrate to , since the exercise of notifying scheduled castes or tribes is region ( state ) specific , i.e " in relation " to the state of their origin . These judgments also took note of the Presidential Notifications , which had enjoined such citizens to be " residents " in relation to the state which provided for such reservations . ( 2 ) The considerations which apply to Scheduled Caste and Tribe citizens who migrate from state to state , apply equally in respect of those who migrate from a state to a union territory , in view of the text of Articles 341 ( 1 ) and 342 ( 1 ) , i.e. only those castes and tribes who are notified in relation to the concerned Union Territory , are entitled to such benefits . This is reinforced by the Presidential Notification in relation to Union Territories , of 1951 .
