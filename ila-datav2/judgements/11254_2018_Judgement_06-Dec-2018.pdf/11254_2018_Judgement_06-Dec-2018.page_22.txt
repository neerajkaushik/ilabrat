22 any person whose name is entered in the permit as the permit holder or any person having the possession or control of such vehicle . It was contended before the Court that words “ or any person for the time being in charge of such vehicle ” in the definition of “ owner ” indicate that the transport or booking agencies which would take the public service motor vehicle on hire would be owners within the definition of the word without being permit holders in respect of these public service motor vehicles . The contention to read definition in particular manner was rejected by this Court . In paragraph Nos . 19 and 21 , following has been held : " 19 . The definition of “ owner ” repels the interpretation submitted by the petitioners that the definition means not only the owner who is the permit holder but also a booking agency which may be in charge of the vehicle without being a permit holder . The entire accent in the definition of owner is on the holder of a permit in respect of the public service motor vehicle . It is the permit which entitles the holder to ply the vehicle . It is because the vehicle is being plied that the passengers and consignors of goods carried by that vehicle become liable to pay not only fare and freight to the owner but also tax thereon to the owner . The words “ or any person for the time being in charge of such vehicle or responsible for the management of the place of business of such owner ” indicate that the permit holder will include any person who is in charge of such vehicle of the permit holder or any person who is responsible for the management of the place of business of such owner . The owner can not escape the liability by stating that any person is for the time being in charge of such vehicles , and , therefore , such person is the owner and not the permit holder .
