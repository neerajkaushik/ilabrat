Whatever be the nature of federalism present in the Indian Constitution , whether absolutely federal or quasi - federal , the fact of the matter is that federalism is a part of the basic structure of our Constitution as every State is a constituent unit which has an exclusive Legislature and Executive elected and constituted by the same process as in the case of the Union Government . The resultant effect is that one can perceive the distinct aim to preserve and protect the unity and the territorial integrity of India . This is a special feature of our constitutional federalism . ” Constitution Bench also noticed the concept of cooperative federalism and referring to an earlier judgment of this Court in State of Rajasthan Vs . Union of India , scc 592 laid down following in paragraph No . 121 and 122 : “ 121 . In State of Rajasthan v. Union of India , the Court took cognizance of the concept of cooperative federalism as perceived by G. Austin and A.H. Birch when it observed : ( SCC p. 622 , para 58 ) “ 58 . Mr Austin thought that our system , if it could be called federal , could be described as “ cooperative federalism ” . This term was used by another author , Mr A.H. Birch ( see Federalism , Finance and Social Legislation in Canada , Australia and the United States , p. 305 ) , to describe a system in which : ‘ .. the practice of administrative cooperation between general and regional Governments , the partial dependence of the regional Governments upon payments from the general Governments and the fact that the general governments , by the use of conditional grants , frequently promote developments in matters which are constitutionally assigned to the regions . ’ ” ( 1977 ) 3
