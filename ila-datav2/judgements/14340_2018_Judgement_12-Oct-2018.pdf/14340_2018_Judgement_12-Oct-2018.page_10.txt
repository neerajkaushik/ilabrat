10 deceased employee for periods set out in the Rules and after the said period the family was entitled to receive family pension . The family was also entitled to retain the Government accommodation for a period of one year in addition to payment of Rs.25,000/- as ex gratia . In this case , the three - Judge Bench adverted to the principles laid down in Helen C. Rebello case ( supra ) , followed in Patricia Jean Mahajan case ( supra ) , and came to the conclusion that the decision in Vimal Kanwar case ( supra ) did not take a view contrary to Helen C. Rebello or Patricia Jean Mahajan case ( supra ) . The following observations are relevant : “ 15 . The principle expounded in this decision in Helen C. Rebello case that the application of general principles under the common law to estimate damages can not be invoked for computing compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act . Further , the “ pecuniary advantage ” from whatever source must correlate to the injury or death caused on account of motor accident . The view so taken is the correct analysis and interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act of 1939 , and must apply proprio vigore to the corresponding provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act , 1988 . This principle has been restated in the subsequent decision of the two - Judge Bench in Patricia Jean Mahajan case , to reject the argument of the Insurance Company to deduct the amount receivable by the dependants of the deceased by way of “ social security compensation ” and “ life insurance policy . ”
