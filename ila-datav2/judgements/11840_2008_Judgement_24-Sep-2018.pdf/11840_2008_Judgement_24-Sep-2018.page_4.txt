240 days in one calendar year and , therefore , entitled for protection of the labour laws ; Secondly , no enquiry was conducted by the Bank before his termination ; Thirdly , he was not paid any retrenchment compensation as provided under Section 25 ( F ) of the ID Act prior to his termination and , therefore , it is a case of illegal termination ; and lastly , since no evidence was led by the Bank to prove that he was gainfully employed elsewhere , he was entitled to claim full back wages . With these findings , the Labour Court set aside the termination order and directed for reinstatement of Bhagirath Singh in service with payment of full back wages . The Bank then on 10.01.1985 allowed Bhagirath Singh to join as Clerk and he accordingly joined the services pursuant to the award passed by the Labour Court .
