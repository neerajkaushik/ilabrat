above rationale in terms of the present case , if the share application money that is received is deposited in the bank in light of the statutory mandatory requirement then the accrued interest is not liable to be taxed and is eligible for deduction against the public issue expenses . The issue of share relates to capital structure of the company and hence expenses incurred in connection with the issue of shares are to be capitalized because the purpose of such deposit is not to make some additional income but to comply with the statutory requirement , and interest accrued on such deposit is merely incidental . In the present case , the Respondent was statutorily required to keep the share application money in the bank till the allotment of shares was complete . In that sense , we are of the view that the High Court was right in holding that the interest accrued to such deposit of money in the bank is liable to be set - off against the public issue expenses that the company has incurred as the interest earned was inextricably linked with requirement of the company to raise share capital and was thus adjustable towards the expenditure involved for the share issue . 11
