The petitioner also challenged his conviction and sentences imposed by filing Criminal Appeal No . 80 of 2014 before the High Court . The said appeal as well as reference were heard together by the High Court . The High Court upheld the conviction under the aforesaid provisions and also confirmed death sentence of the petitioner vide its judgment dated July 09/10 , 2014 . 5 . It is this judgment which is assailed in the present appeal . In the first instance , we have heard learned counsel for the parties on the question as to whether the conviction of the appellant has been rightly recorded by the trial court , and affirmed by the High Court . Learned counsel for both the parties have taken us through the material on record as well as relevant evidence which was produced by the prosecution before the trial court . No doubt itis a case of circumstantial evidence as there are no eye - witnesses . At the same time , we find that the circumstances produced before the trial court weave an unbroken chain which point accusing finger towards the appellant thereby proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt . These circumstances are recorded by the High Court as well in para 8 of the judgment . There are as many as eleven incriminating circumstances which have been proved on record . These include the circumstances of last seen , namely , appellant was found talking with the victim girl and taking her to his house . Such an occurrence was seen by PW-4 Dharmendra , PW-5 Shrikant ,
