2 15.07.2013 and some of the claimants are already before the Reference Court . We are also informed that compensation has neither been paid nor offered to some of the claimants . Having regard to the purpose for which the acquisition was sought to be made and having regard to several rounds of litigation , we are of the view that it is only in larger public interest and also for doing complete justice between parties that the litigations are given a quietus . It is in the interest of claimants also that they should get a just , fair and proper value for their lands at the earliest . Accordingly , we direct the Reference Court to dispose of the cases pending for enhancement in respect of the acquisition under challenge within a period of three months from today . 5 . We make it clear that the Reference Court shall not make any reference to any of the affidavits filed before this Court or any orders passed by this Court in these proceedings . As far as those claimants who have not gone to the Reference Court , they shall be entitled to file application under Section 28A of the Act within a period of three months after the award of the Reference Court for redetermination of the compensation . The Collector shall take action on the applications for redetermination within three months thereafter . While passing final orders on the application for redetermination , the Collector shall verify whether any appeals have been filed against the awards passed by the Reference Court under Section 54 of the Act
