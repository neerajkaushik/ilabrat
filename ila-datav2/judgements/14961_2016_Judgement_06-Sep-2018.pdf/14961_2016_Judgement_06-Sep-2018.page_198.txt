Toonen , who resided in the state of Tasmania , had been the victim of arbitrary interference with his privacy , and whether he had been discriminated against on the basis of his sexual orientation of being a homosexual . The Committee found : “ 8.2 Inasmuch as Article 17 is concerned , it is undisputed that adult consensual sexual activity in private is covered by the concept of “ privacy ” , and that Mr. Toonen is actually and currently affected by the continued existence of the Tasmanian laws . The Committee considers that Sections 122 ( a ) , ( c ) and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code “ interfere ” with the author 's privacy , even if these provisions have not been enforced for a decade . In this context , it notes that the policy of the Department of Public Prosecutions not to initiate criminal proceedings in respect of private homosexual conduct does not amount to a guarantee that no actions will be brought against homosexuals in the future , particularly in the light of undisputed statements of the Director of Public Prosecutions of Tasmania in 1988 and those of members of the Tasmanian Parliament . The continued existence of the challenged provisions therefore continuously and directly “ interferes ” with the author 's privacy . 8.3 The prohibition against private homosexual behaviour is provided for by law , namely , Sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code . As to whether it may be deemed arbitrary , the Committee recalls that pursuant to its General Comment 16 on article 17 , the " introduction of the concept of arbitrariness is intended to guarantee that even interference provided for by the law should be in accordance with the provisions , aims and objectives of the Covenant and should be , in any event , reasonable in the _ circumstances”.(4 ) The 32
