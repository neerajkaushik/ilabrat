PART J operates to deprive same - sex couples of the benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of their marriages . This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law . DOMA ’s avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a disadvantage , a separate status , and so a stigma upon all who enter into same - sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States . ” Two years later , in Obergefell v. Hodges ( “ Obergefell”),28 ° while analysing precedent and decisions of other US courts recognizing same - sex marriage , Justice Kennedy observed that : “ A first premise of the Court ’s relevant precedents is that the right to personal choice regarding marriage is inherent in the concept of individual autonomy ... Like choices concerning contraception , family relationships , procreation , and childrearing , all of which are protected by the Constitution , decisions concerning marriage are among the most intimate that an individual can make . ”?64 122 Justice Kennedy expressed the need to go beyond the narrow holding in Lawrence , towards a more expansive view of the rights of homosexuals : “ Lawrence invalidated laws that made same- sex intimacy a criminal act ... But while Lawrence confirmed a dimension of freedom that allows individuals to engage in intimate association without criminal liability , it does not follow that freedom stops there . Outlaw to outcast may be a step forward , but it does not achieve the full promise of liberty . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 283576 U.S. _ _ _ ( 2015 ) . 284 Obergefell , at page 12 . 138
