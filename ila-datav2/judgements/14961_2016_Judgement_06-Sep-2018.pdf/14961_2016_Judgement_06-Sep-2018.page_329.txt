PART E ( “ Puttaswamy ” ) ' ' ” , this Court affirmed the individual as the bearer of the constitutional guarantee of rights . Such rights are devoid of their guarantee when despite legal recognition , the social , economic and political context enables an atmosphere of continued discrimination . The Constitution enjoins upon every individual a commitment to a constitutional democracy characterized by the principles of equality and inclusion . In a constitutional democracy committed to the protection of individual dignity and autonomy , the state and every individual has a duty to act in a manner that advances and promotes the constitutional order of values . By criminalizing consensual sexual conduct between two homosexual adults , Section 377 has become the basis not just of prosecutions but of the persecution of members of the affected community . Section 377 leads to the perpetuation of a culture of silence and _ stigmatization . Section 377 perpetuates notions of morality which prohibit certain relationships as being against the ‘ order of nature . ’ A criminal provision has _ sanctioned discrimination grounded on stereotypes imposed on an entire class of persons on grounds prohibited by Article 15(1 ) . This constitutes discrimination on the grounds only of sex and violates the guarantee of non - discrimination in Article 15(1 ) 117(2017 ) 10 SCC 1 67
