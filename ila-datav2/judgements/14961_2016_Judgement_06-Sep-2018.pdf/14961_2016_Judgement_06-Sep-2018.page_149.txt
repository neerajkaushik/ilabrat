It is a vital personal right falling within the private protective sphere and realm of individual choice and autonomy . Such progressive proclivity is rooted in the constitutional structure and is an inextricable part of human nature . 241 . In the adverting situation , we must also examine whether Section 377 , in its present form , stands the test of Article 19 of the Constitution in the sense of whether it is unreasonable and , therefore , violative of Article 19 .
