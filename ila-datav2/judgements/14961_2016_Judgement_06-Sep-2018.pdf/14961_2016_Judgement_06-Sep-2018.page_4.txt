deliberation and focus on the said concept shall be from various spectrums . 2 . Shakespeare through one of his characters in a play says “ What 's in a name ? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet ” . The said phrase , in its basic sense , conveys that what really matters is the essential qualities of the substance and the fundamental characteristics of an entity but not the name by which it or a person is called . Getting further deeper into the meaning , it is understood that the name may be a convenient concept for identification but the essence behind the same is the core of identity . Sans identity , the name only remains a denotative term . Therefore , the identity is pivotal to one ’s being . Life bestows honour on it and freedom of living , as a facet of life , expresses genuine desire to have it . The said desire , one is inclined to think , is satisfied by the conception of constitutional recognition , and hence , emphasis is laid on the identity of an individual which is conceived under the Constitution . And the sustenance of identity is the filament of life . It is equivalent to authoring one ’s own life script where freedom broadens everyday . Identity is equivalent to divinity .
