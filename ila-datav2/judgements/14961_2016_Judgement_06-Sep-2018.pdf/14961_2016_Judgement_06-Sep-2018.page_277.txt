PART C Another Judeo - Christian religious interpretation refers to “ sodomy ” , a term used for anal intercourse that is derived from an interpretation of Genesis 18:20 of the Old Testament , ' * known as the story of Sodom and Gomorrah . Briefly , when two angels took refuge in the home of Lot , the men of the town of Sodom surrounded the house and demanded that the angels be sent out so that the men may “ know ” them ( in this interpretation , with sexual connotations ) .
