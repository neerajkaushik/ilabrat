PART E 51 ‘ In Navtej Johar v. Union of India ‘ ' ’ , with which this case is concerned , the Petitioners have set out multiple instances of discrimination and expulsion . The following is a realistic account : “ While society , friends and family are accepting of my sexuality , | can not be fully open about my identity and my relationships because | constantly fear arrest and violence by the police ... Without the existence of this section , the social prejudice and shame that | have faced would have been considerably lessened ... the fact that gay people , like me , are recognized only as criminals is deeply upsetting and denies me the dignity and respect that | feel | deserve.1'4 Apart from the visible social manifestations of Section 377 , the retention of the provision perpetuates a certain culture . The stereotypes fostered by section 377 have an impact on how other individuals and non - state institutions treat the community . While this behaviour is not sanctioned by Section 377 , the existence of the provision nonetheless facilitates it by perpetuating homophobic attitudes and making it almost impossible for victims of abuse to access justice . Thus , the social effects of such a provision , even when it is enforced with zeal , is to sanction verbal harassment , familial fear , restricted access to public spaces and the lack of safe spaces . This results in a denial of the self . Identities are obliterated , denying the entitlement to equal participation and dignity under the Constitution . Section 377 deprives them of an equal citizenship .
