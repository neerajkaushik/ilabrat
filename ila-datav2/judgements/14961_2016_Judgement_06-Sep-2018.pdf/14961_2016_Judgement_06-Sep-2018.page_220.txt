modern medical technology . It is a state where the treating physicians and the family members know fully well that the treatment is administered only to procrastinate the continuum of breath of the individual and the patient is not even aware that he is breathing . Life is measured by artificial heartbeats and the patient has to go through this undignified state which is imposed on him . The dignity of life is denied to him as there is no other choice but to suffer an avoidable protracted treatment thereby thus indubitably casting a cloud and creating a dent in his right to live with dignity and face death with dignity , which is a preserved concept of bodily autonomy and right to privacy . In such a stage , he has no old memories or any future hopes but he is in a state of misery which nobody ever desires to have . Some may also silently think that death , the inevitable factum of life , can not be invited . To meet such situations , the Court has a duty to interpret Article 21 in a further dynamic manner and it has to be stated without any trace of doubt that the right to life with dignity has to include the smoothening of the process of dying when the person is in a vegetative state or is living exclusively by the administration of artificial aid that prolongs the life by arresting the dignified and inevitable process of dying . Here , the issue of choice also comes in . Thus analysed , we are disposed to think that such a right would come within the ambit of Article 21 of the Constitution . L. Right of self - determination and individual autonomy 167 . Having dealt with the right to acceleration of the process of dying a natural death which is arrested with the aid of modern innovative technology as a part of Article 21 of the Constitution , it is necessary to address the issues of right of selfdetermination and individual autonomy . 54
