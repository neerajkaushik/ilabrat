84 has become a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution and that ushers in the right of liberty of expression . Dignity and liberty as a twin concept in a society that cares for both , apart from painting a grand picture of humanity , also smoothens the atmosphere by promoting peaceful co - existence and thereby makes the administration of justice easy . In such a society , everyone becomes a part of the social engineering process where rights as inviolable and sacrosanct principles are adhered to ; individual choice is not an exception and each one gets his / her space . Though no tower is built , yet the tower of individual rights with peaceful co - existence is visible . 130 . In Common Cause ( A Regd . Society ) ( supra ) , one of us has observed that human dignity is beyond definition and it may , at times , defy description . To some , it may seem to be in the world of abstraction and some may even perversely treat it as an attribute of egotism or accentuated eccentricity . This feeling may come from the roots of absolute cynicism , but what really matters is that life without dignity is like a sound that is not heard . Dignity speaks , it has its sound , it is natural and human . It is a combination of thought and feeling .
