PART J “ It must be concluded that the State ’s interest could have been weighed against Phillips ’ sincere religious objections in a way consistent with the requisite religious neutrality that must be strictly observed . The official expressions of hostility to religion in some of the commissioners ’ comments — comments that were not disavowed at the Commission or by the State at any point in the proceedings that led to affirmance of the order — were inconsistent with what the Free Exercise Clause requires . The Commission ’s disparate consideration of Phillips ’ case compared to the cases of the other bakers suggests the same . For these reasons , the order must be set aside . ” The majority held that while the Constitution allows gay persons to exercise their civil rights , “ religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression . ” The Supreme Court found merit in the baker ’s First Amendment claim , noting that his dilemma was understandable , especially given that the cause of action arose in 2012 , before the enactment of Colorado ’s anti - discrimination law and the Obergefell judgment that legalised same - sex marriage . The court buttressed its position by noting that in several other cases , bakers had declined to decorate cakes with messages that were derogatory towards gay persons and the State Civil Rights Division had held that the bakers were within their rights to have done so . According to the majority in Masterpiece Cakeshop , the owner was similarly entitled to decline the order , and his case should have been treated no differently . 140
