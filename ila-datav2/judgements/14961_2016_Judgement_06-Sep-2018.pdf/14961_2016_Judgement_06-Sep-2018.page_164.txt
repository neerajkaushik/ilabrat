( xv ) 164 has resulted in an unwanted collateral effect whereby even ‘ consensual sexual acts ’ , which are neither harmful to children nor women , by the LGBTs have been woefully targeted thereby resulting in discrimination and unequal treatment to the LGBT community and is , thus , violative of Article 14 of the Constitution . Section 377 IPC , so far as it criminalises even consensual sexual acts between competent adults , fails to make a distinction between non - consensual and consensual sexual acts of competent adults in private space which are neither harmful nor contagious to the society . Section 377 IPC subjects the LGBT community to societal pariah and dereliction and is , therefore , manifestly arbitrary , for it has become an odious weapon for the harassment of the LGBT community by subjecting them to discrimination and unequal treatment . Therefore , in view of the law laid down in Shayara Bano ( supra ) , Section 377 IPC is liable to be partially struck down for being violative of Article 14 of the Constitution .
