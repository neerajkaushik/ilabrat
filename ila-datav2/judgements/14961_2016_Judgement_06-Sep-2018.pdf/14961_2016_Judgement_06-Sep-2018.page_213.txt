popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection . Discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers ’ of discrimination for the simple reason that their views , beliefs or way of life does not accord with the “ mainstream ” . Yet in a democratic Constitution founded on the Rule of Law , their rights are as sacred as those conferred on other citizens to protect their freedoms and _ liberties . Sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy . Discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation is deeply offensive to the dignity and self - worth of the individual . Equality demands that the sexual orientation of each individual in society must be protected on an even platform . The right to privacy and the protection of sexual orientation lie at the core of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 , 15 and 21 of the Constitution . 145 . The view in Koushal [ Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation , ( 2014 ) 1 SCC 1 : ( 2013 ) 4 SCC ( Cri ) 1 ] that the High Court had erroneously relied upon international precedents “ in its anxiety to protect the so - called rights of LGBT persons ” is similarly , in our view , unsustainable . The rights of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and _ transgender population can not be construed to be “ so - called rights ” . The expression “ so - called ” seems to suggest the exercise of a liberty in the garb of a right which is illusory . This is an inappropriate construction of the privacy - based claims of the LGBT population . Their rights are not “ so - called ” but are real rights founded on sound constitutional doctrine . They inhere in the right to life . They dwell in privacy and dignity . They constitute the essence of liberty and freedom . Sexual orientation is an essential component of identity . Equal protection demands protection of the identity of every individual without discrimination . 47
