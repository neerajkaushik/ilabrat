PART E in India . The order of nature that Section 377 speaks of is not just about nonprocreative sex but is about forms of intimacy which the social order finds “ disturbing ” . ® ° This includes various forms of transgression such as inter - caste and inter - community relationships which are sought to be curbed by society . What links LGBT individuals to couples who love across caste and community lines is the fact that both are exercising their right to love at enormous personal risk and in the process disrupting existing lines of social authority . * ' Thus , a re - imagination of the order of nature as being not only about the prohibition of non - procreative sex but instead about the limits imposed by structures such as gender , caste , class , religion and community makes the right to love not just a separate battle for LGBT individuals , but a battle for all.82 E Beyond physicality : sex , identity and stereotypes “ Only in the most technical sense is this a case about who may penetrate whom where . At a practical and symbolical level it is about the status , moral citizenship and sense of selfworth of a significant section of the community . At a more general and conceptual level , it concerns the nature of the open , democratic and pluralistic society contemplated by the Constitution . ” ® ° 80 Supra note 7 . 81 Ibid . 82 Supra note 7 . 83 The National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v.
