125 lesbians are less worthy of protection as individuals in Canada â€™s society and the potential harm to the dignity and perceived worth of gay and lesbian individuals constitutes a particularly cruel form of discrimination . ( iii ) South Africa 200 . The Constitutional Court of South Africa in National Coalition for Gay & Lesbian Equality ( supra ) made the following relevant observations : " Its symbolic effect is to state that in the eyes of our legal system all gay men are criminals . The stigma thus attached to a significant proportion of our population is manifest . But the harm imposed by the criminal law is far more than symbolic . As a result of the criminal offence , gay men are at risk of arrest , prosecution and conviction of the offence of sodomy simply because they seek to engage in sexual conduct which is part of their experience of being human . Just as apartheid legislation rendered the lives of couples of different racial groups perpetually at risk , the sodomy offence builds insecurity and vulnerability into the daily lives of gay men . There can be no doubt that the existence of a law which punishes a form of sexual expression for gay men degrades and devalues gay men in our broader society . As such it is a palpable invasion of their dignity and a breach of section 10 of the Constitution . "
