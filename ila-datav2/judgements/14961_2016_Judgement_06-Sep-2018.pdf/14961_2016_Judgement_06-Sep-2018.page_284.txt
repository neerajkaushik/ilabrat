PART C After twenty - five years of revision , the IPC entered into force on 1 January 1862 , two years after Lord Macaulay 's death . The IPC was the first codified criminal code in the British Empire . Section 377 of the revised code read as follows : “ Of Unnatural Offences 377 . Unnatural Offences.- Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animal , shall be punished with [ imprisonment for life] ® 5 , or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years , and shall also be liable to fine . Explanation.- Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section . ” 22 ~The Explanation is unique in that it requires proof of penetration — something that British Law did not . The two clauses in the Draft Code fell somewhere in between , requiring proof of “ touch”. ° 6 By the time India gained independence in 1947 , Britain had introduced Penal Codes similar to the IPC in other former colonies , including Zanzibar ( Tanzania ) in 1867 , Singapore , Malaysia , and Brunei in 1871 , Ceylon ( Sri Lanka ) in 1885 , Burma ( Myanmar ) in 1886 , ° ” East Africa Protectorate ( Kenya ) !
