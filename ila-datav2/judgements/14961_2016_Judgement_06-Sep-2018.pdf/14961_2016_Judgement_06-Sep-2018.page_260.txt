homosexual adults which is a distinction which has no rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Section namely , the criminalization of all carnal sex between homosexual and/or heterosexual adults as being against the order of nature . ’ Viewed either way , the Section falls foul of Article 14 . 95 . The fact that only a minuscule fraction of the country ’s population constitutes lesbians and gays or transgenders , and that in the last 150 years less than 200 persons have been prosecuted for committing the offence under Section 377 , is neither here nor there . When it is found that privacy interests come in and the State has no compelling reason to continue an existing law which penalizes same - sex couples who cause no harm to others , on an application of the recent judgments delivered by this Court after Suresh Kumar Koushal ( supra ) , it is clear that Articles 14 , 15 , 19 and 21 have all been transgressed without any legitimate state rationale to uphold such provision . 8 An argument was made by the Petitioners that Section 377 , being vague and unintelligible , should be struck down on this ground as it is not clear as to what is meant by “ against the order of nature ” . Since Section 377 applies down the line to carnal sex between human beings and animals as well , which is not the subject matter of challenge here , it is unnecessary to go into this ground as the Petitioners have succeeded on other grounds raised by them . 94
