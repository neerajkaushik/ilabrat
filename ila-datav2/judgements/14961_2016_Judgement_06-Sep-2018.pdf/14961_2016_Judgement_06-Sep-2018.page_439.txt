PART M sexual conduct , the statutory provision violates the constitutional guarantees of liberty and equality . It denudes members of the LGBT communities of their constitutional right to lead fulfilling lives . In its application to adults of the same sex engaged in consensual sexual behaviour , it violates the constitutional guarantee of the right to life and to the equal protection of law . 148 Sexual orientation is integral to the identity of the members of the LGBT communities . It is intrinsic to their dignity , inseparable from their autonomy and at the heart of their privacy . Section 377 is founded on moral notions which are an anathema to a constitutional order in which liberty must trump over stereotypes and prevail over the mainstreaming of culture . Our Constitution , above all , is an essay in the acceptance of diversity . It is founded on a vision of an inclusive society which accommodates plural ways of life . 149 The impact of Section 377 has travelled far beyond criminalising certain acts . The presence of the provision on the statute book has reinforced stereotypes about sexual orientation . It has lent the authority of the state to the suppression of identities . The fear of persecution has led to the closeting of same sex relationships . A penal provision has reinforced societal disdain . 177
