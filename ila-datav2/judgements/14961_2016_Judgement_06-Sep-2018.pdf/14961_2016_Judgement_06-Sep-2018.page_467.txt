following quote by John Gardener to provide context to the aforesaid commonality : “ Discrimination _ on_the basis of our immutable status tends to deny us [ an_autonomousJ life . Its result is that our further choices are constrained not mainly by our own choices , but by the choices of others . Because these choices of others are based on our immutable status , our own choices can make no difference to them . ..... And discrimination on the ground of fundamental choices can be wrongful by the same token . To lead an autonomous life we need an adequate range of valuable options throughout that life .... there are some particular valuable options that each of us should have irrespective of our other choices . Where a particular choice is a choice between valuable options which ought to be available to people whatever else they may choose , it is a fundamental choice . Where there is discrimination against people based on their fundamental choices it tends to skew those choices by making one or more of the valuable options from which they must choose more painful or burdensome than others . ” ? ® ( emphasis supplied )      Race , caste , sex , and place of birth are aspects over which a person has no control , ergo they are immutable . On the other hand , religion is a fundamental choice of a person.2 ” Discrimination based on any of these grounds would undermine an individual ’s personal autonomy . 26 John Gardner , On the Ground of Her Sex ( uality ) , 18(2 ) Oxford Journal of Legal Studies ( 1998 ) , at p. 167 27 Supra note 25 24
