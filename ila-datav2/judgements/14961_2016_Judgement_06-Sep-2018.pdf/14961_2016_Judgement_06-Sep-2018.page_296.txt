PART D He questions the elevated status of ‘ normalcy ’ in the following words : “ Normal ” is a loaded word , of course , and it has been misused throughout history . Hierarchical ordering leading to slavery was at one time accepted as normal , as was a geocentric cosmology . It was only by questioning the foundations of the consensus view that “ normal ” phenomena were dethroned from their privileged positions . ” There are obvious shortcomings of the human element in the judgment of natural and unnatural : “ Why judge what is natural and ethical to a human being by his or her animal nature ? Many of the things human beings value , such as medicine and art , are egregiously unnatural . At the same time , humans detest many things that actually are eminently natural , like disease and death . If we consider some naturally occurring phenomena ethical and others unethical , that means our minds ( the things looking ) are determining what to make of nature ( the things being looked at ) . Nature does n’t exist somewhere “ out there , ” independently of us — we 're always already interpreting it from the inside . ” It has been argued that “ the ‘ naturalness ’ and omnipresence of heterosexuality is manufactured by an elimination of historical specificities about the organisation , regulation and deployment of sexuality across time and space . ” It is thus this “ closeting of history ” that produces the “ hegemonic heterosexual ” - the ideological construction of a particular alignment of sex , gender and desire that posits itself as natural , inevitable and eternal . ® Heterosexuality becomes the site where the male sexed masculine man ’s desire for the female sexed feminine woman is privileged over all other forms 65 Zaid Al Baset , “ Section 377 and the Myth of Heterosexuality ” , Jindal Global Law Review , Vol . 4 ( 2012 ) . 66 Ibid . 34
