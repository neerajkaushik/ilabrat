PART B 10 Bereft of a submission on behalf of the Union government on a matter of constitutional principle these proceedings must be dealt with in the only manner known to the constitutional court : through an adjudication which fulfills constitutional values and principles . 11 . The ASG made a fair submission when he urged that the court should deal with the matter in reference . The submission , to its credit , would have the court follow a path of prudence . Prudence requires , after all , that the Court should address itself to the controversy in the reference without pursuing an uncharted course beyond it . While accepting the wisdom of the approach suggested by the ASG , it is nonetheless necessary to make some prefatory observations on the scope of the reference . 12 The correctness of the decision in Koushal is in question . Koushal [ as indeed the decision of the Delhi High Court in Naz Foundation v. Government of NCT of Delhi * ( “ Naz ” ) ] dealt with the validity of Section 377 which criminalizes even a consensual relationship between adults of the same gender who engage in sexual conduct ( ‘ carnal intercourse against the order of nature ’ ) . In dealing with the validity of the provision , it is necessary to understand the nature of the constitutional right which LGBT individuals claim . 4(2010 ) Cri LJ 94 10
