The judgment of four judges in Puttaswamy held that the right to sexual orientation is an intrinsic part of the right to privacy . To define the scope of the right , it is useful to examine the discussion on the right to sexual orientation in judicial precedents of this Court . 55 Speaking for a two judge Bench in NALSA , Justice K S Radhakrishnan elucidated upon the term ‘ sexual orientation ’ as differentiable from an individual ’s ‘ gender identity ’ , noting that : “ Sexual orientation refers to an individual ’s enduring physical , romantic and/or emotional attraction to another person . Sexual orientation includes transgender and gender - variant people with heavy sexual orientation and their sexual orientation may or may not change during or after gender transmission , which also includes homo - sexuals , bysexuals , heterosexuals , asexual etc . Gender identity and sexual orientation , as already indicated , are different concepts . Each person ’s self - defined sexual orientation and gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self - determination , dignity and freedom . .. ” 122 Puttaswamy rejected the “ test of popular acceptance ” employed by this Court in Koushal and affirmed that sexual orientation is a constitutionally guaranteed freedom : “ ..

The test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection . Discrete and insular 122 NALSA , at para 22 . 70
