103 constitutes , at the same time and independently , a breach of the rights of privacy and dignity which , without doubt , strengthens the conclusion that the discrimination is unfair . 160 . At home , the view as to the right to privacy underwent a seachange when a nine - Judge Bench of this Court in Puttaswamy ( supra ) elevated the right to privacy to the stature of fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution . One of us , Chandrachud , J. , speaking for the majority , regarded the judgment in Suresh Koushal as a discordant note and opined that the reasons stated therein can not be regarded as a valid constitutional basis for disregarding a claim based on privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution . Further , he observed that the reasoning in Suresh Koushal ’s decision to the effect that “ a minuscule fraction of the country 's population constitutes lesbians , gays , bisexuals or transgenders " is not a sustainable basis to deny the right to privacy . 161 . It was further observed that the purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities , whether legislative or popular , and the guarantee of constitutional rights does not depend upon their exercise being favourably regarded by majoritarian opinion .
