PART K 134 Countering Devlin ’s theory , Hart argued that society is not held together by a common morality , for , after all , it is not a hive mind or a monolith , governed by a singular set of morals and principles.*5 ' Hart rebutted Devlin ’s argument in the following way : “ ’ , .apart from one vague reference to ‘ history ’ showing the ‘ the loosening of moral bonds is often the first stage of disintegration , no evidence is produced to show that deviation from accepted sexual morality , even by adults in private is something which , like treason , threatens the existence of society . No reputable historian has maintained this thesis , and there is indeed much evidence against it ... Lord Devlin ’s belief in it [ that homosexuality is a cause of societal disintegration ] , and his apparent indifference to the question of evidence , are at points traceable to an undiscussed assumption . This is that all morality — sexual morality together with the morality that forbids acts injurious to others such as killing , stealing , and dishonesty -- forms a single seamless web , so that those who deviate from any part are likely to perhaps bound to deviate from the whole . It is of course clear ( and one of the oldest insights of political theory ) that society could not exist without a morality which mirrored and supplemented the law ’s proscription of conduct injurious to others . But there is again no evidence to support , and much to refute , the theory that those who deviate from conventional sexual morality are in other ways hostile to society . ”352 Despite countering Devlin , Hart was not completely opposed to a relationship between law and morality , and in fact , he emphasised that the two are closely related : 351 Supra note 346 , at pages 12 - 14 . 352 Hart , H.
