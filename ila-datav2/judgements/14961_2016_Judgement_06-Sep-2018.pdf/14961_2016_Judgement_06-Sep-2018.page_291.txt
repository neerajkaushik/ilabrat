PART D Section 377 does not suffer from arbitrariness or from an _ irrational classification . 26 A litany of our decisions — to refer to them individually would be a parade of the familiar — indicates that to be a reasonable classification under Article 14 of the Constitution , two criteria must be met : ( i ) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia ; and ( ii ) the differentia must have a rational nexus to the objective sought to be achieved by the legislation . ° ° There must , in other words , be a causal connection between the basis of classification and the object of the statute . If the object of the classification is illogical , unfair and unjust , the classification will be unreasonable.54 27 + Equating the content of equality with the reasonableness of a classification on which a law is based advances the cause of legal formalism . The problem with the classification test is that what constitutes a reasonable classification is reduced to a mere formula : the quest for an intelligible differentia and the rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved . In doing so , the test of classification risks elevating form over substance . The danger inherent in legal formalism lies in its inability to lay threadbare the values which guide the process of judging constitutional rights . Legal formalism 53 State of West Bengal v.
