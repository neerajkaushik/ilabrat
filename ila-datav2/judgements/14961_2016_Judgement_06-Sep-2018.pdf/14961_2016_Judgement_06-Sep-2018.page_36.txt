36 48 . The applicant has also submitted that in the event consenting acts between two same sex adults are excluded from the ambit of Section 377 IPC , then a married woman would be rendered remediless under the IPC against her bi - sexual husband and his consenting male partner indulging in any sexual acts . 49 . The intervenor has suggested that the alleged misuse of Section 377 IPC as highlighted by the petitioners can be curbed by adding an explanation to Section 377 IPC defining ‘ aggrieved person ' which shall include only non - consenting partner or aggrieved person or wife or husband or any person on their behalf on the lines of Section 198(1 ) of Code of Criminal Procedure , 1973 . This , as per the applicant , would curb any mala fide complaint lodged by authorities and vindictive or mischievous persons when the act complained of is ‘ consenting act ' between two persons . Further , the applicant has submitted that this Court may be pleased to identify that the courts shall take cognizance of an offence under Section 377 IPC only on a complaint made by an aggrieved person . Such an approach , as per the applicant , inherently respects consent and also protects from interference and safeguards the privacy and dignity of an individual under Article 21 of the Constitution .
