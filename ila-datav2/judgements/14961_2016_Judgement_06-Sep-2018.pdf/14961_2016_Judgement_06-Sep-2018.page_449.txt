arrested development . Homosexuality was treated as a disorder or mental illness , which was meted out with social ostracism and revulsion . . Towards the end of the 20 t century , this notion began to change , and the earlier theories gave way to a more enlightened perspective that characterized homosexuality as a normal and natural variant of human sexuality . Scientific studies indicated that human sexuality is complex and inherent . Kurt Hiller in his speech delivered at the Second International Congress for Sexual Reform held at Copenhagen in 19286 , stated : “ Same - sex love is not a mockery of nature , but rather nature at play ... As Nietzsche expressed it in Daybreak , Procreation is a frequently occurring accidental result of one way of satisfying the sexual drive — it is neither its goal nor its necessary consequence . The theory which would make procreation the goal of sexuality is exposed as hasty , simplistic and false by the phenomenon of same - sex love alone . Nature ’s laws , unlike the laws formulated by the human mind , can not be violated . The assertion that a specific phenomenon of nature could somehow be “ contrary to nature ” amounts to pure absurdity ... To belong , not to the rule , not to the norm , but rather to the exception , to the minority , to the variety , is neither a symptom of degeneration nor of pathology . ”              4 + Benjamin J.
