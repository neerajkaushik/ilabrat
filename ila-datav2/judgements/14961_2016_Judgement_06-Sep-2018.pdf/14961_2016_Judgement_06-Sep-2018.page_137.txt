137 does not per se make it against the order of nature . 217 . Section 377 criminalises even voluntary carnal intercourse not only between homosexuals but also between heterosexuals . The major difference between the language of Section 377 and Section 375 is that of the element of absence consent which has been elaborately incorporated in the seven descriptions contained in the latter part of Section 375 IPC . It is the absence of willful and informed consent embodied in the seven descriptions to Section 375 which makes the offence of rape criminal . 218 . On the other hand , Section 377 IPC contains no such descriptions / exceptions embodying the absence of willful and informed consent and criminalises even voluntary carnal intercourse both between homosexuals as well as between heterosexuals . While saying so , we gain strength and support from the fact that the legislature , in its wisdom , while enacting Section 375 IPC in its amended form after the Criminal Law ( Amendment ) Act , 2013 , has not employed the words “ subject to any other provision of the IPC ’ . The implication of the absence of these words simply indicates that Section 375 IPC which does not criminalize consensual carnal intercourse between heterosexuals is not subject to Section 377 IPC .
