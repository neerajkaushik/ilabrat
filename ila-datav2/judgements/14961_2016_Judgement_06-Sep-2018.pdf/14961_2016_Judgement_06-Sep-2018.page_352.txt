PART G In Devika Biswas v. Union of India ‘ ® ° , while hearing a public interest petition concerning several deaths that had taken place due to unsanitary conditions in sterilization camps across the country , a two judge Bench of this Court held that : “ It is well established that the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution includes the right to lead a dignified and meaningful life and the right to health is an integral facet of this right ... That the right to health is an integral part of the right to life does not need any repetition . ” In his concurring judgment in Common Cause v. Union of India , Sikri J , noted the inextricable link between the right to health and dignity : “ There is a related , but interesting , aspect of this dignity which needs to be emphasised . Right to health is a part of Article 21 of the Constitution . At the same time , it is also a harsh reality that everybody is not able to enjoy that right because of poverty etc . The State is not in a position to translate into reality this right to health for all citizens . Thus , when citizens are not guaranteed the right to health , can they be denied right to die in dignity ? ” ( Emphasis supplied ) In addition to the constitutional recognition granted to the right to health , the right to health is also recognised in international treaties , covenants , and agreements which India has ratified , including the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , 1966 ( “ ICESCR ” ) and the Universal 180 ( 2016 ) 10 SCC 726 90
