153 transgenders by denying them their dignity , personhood and above all , their basic human rights . It is important to realize that identity and sexual orientation can not be silenced by oppression . Liberty , as the linchpin of our constitutional values , enables individuals to define and express their identity and individual identity has to be acknowledged and respected . 249 . The very existence of Section 377 IPC criminalising transgenders casts a great stigma on an already oppressed and discriminated class of people . This stigma , oppression and prejudice has to be eradicated and the transgenders have to progress from their narrow claustrophobic spaces of mere survival in hiding with their isolation and fears to enjoying the richness of living out of the shadows with full realization of their potential and equal opportunities in all walks of life . The ideals and objectives enshrined in our benevolent Constitution can be achieved only when each and every individual is empowered and enabled to participate in the social mainstream and in the journey towards achieving equality in all spheres , equality of opportunities in all walks of life , equal freedoms and rights and , above all , equitable justice . This can be achieved only by inclusion of all and exclusion of none from the mainstream .
