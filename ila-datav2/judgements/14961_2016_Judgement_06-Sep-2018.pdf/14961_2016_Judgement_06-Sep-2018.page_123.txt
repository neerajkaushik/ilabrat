123 ( ii ) Canada 197 . The Supreme Court of Canada , in Delwin Vriend and others v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Alberta and others Â® ' , while interpreting a breach of Section 15(1 ) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms , arrived at the conclusion that ' sex ' includes sexual orientation . Section 15(1 ) of the Charter reads thus : " Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and , in particular , without discrimination based on race , national or ethnic origin , colour , religion , sex , age or physical disability . " 198 . In Delwin Vriend , the Supreme Court of Canada , relying on the reasoning adopted by it in Egan v. Canada ( supra ) , applied its wellknown test of grounds analogous to those specified textually . The Egan test is : " In Egan , it was said that there are two aspects which are relevant in determining whether the distinction created by the law constitutes discrimination . First , " whether the equality right was denied on the basis of a personal characteristic which is either enumerated in s. 15(1 ) or which is analogous to those enumerated " . Second " whether that distinction has the effect on the claimant of imposing a _ burden , obligation or disadvantage not imposed upon others or of withholding or limiting access to benefits or advantages which are available to others " ( para . 131 ) . 5111998 ] 1 SCR 493
