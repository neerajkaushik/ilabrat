PART J By a 5 - 4 majority , the US Supreme Court ruled that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same - sex couples by the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution . Commenting on the right to marriage , Justice Kennedy noted : “ No union is more profound than marriage , for it embodies the highest ideals of love , fidelity , devotion , sacrifice , and family . ... It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage . Their plea is that they do respect it , respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfilment for themselves . Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness , excluded from one of civilization ’s oldest institutions . They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law . The Constitution grants them that right . ” 123 The recent case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v.
