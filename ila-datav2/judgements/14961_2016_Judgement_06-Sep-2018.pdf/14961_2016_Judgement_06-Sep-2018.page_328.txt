PART E inducing “ a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power ’ , ' ' ® Ryan Goodman writes : “ The state 's relationship to lesbian and gay individuals under a regime of sodomy laws constructs a similar , yet dispersed , structure of observation and surveillance . The public is sensitive to the visibility of lesbians and gays as socially and legally constructed miscreants . Admittedly certain individuals , namely those who are certified with various levels of state authority , are more directly linked to the extension of law 's power . Yet the social effects of sodomy laws are not tied to these specialized agents alone . On the ground level , private individuals also perform roles of policing and controlling lesbian and gay lives in a mimetic relation to the modes of justice itself . ”16 ( Emphasis supplied ) The effect of Section 377 , thus , is not merely to criminalize an act , but to criminalize a specific set of identities . Though facially neutral , the effect of the provision is to efface specific identities . These identities are the soul of the LGBT community . 52 ~The Constitution envisaged a transformation in the order of relations not just between the state and the individual , but also between individuals : in a constitutional order characterized by the Rule of Law , the constitutional commitment to egalitarianism and an anti - discriminatory ethos permeates and infuses these relations .
