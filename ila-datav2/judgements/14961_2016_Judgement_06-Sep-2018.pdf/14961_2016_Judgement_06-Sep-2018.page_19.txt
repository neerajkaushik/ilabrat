19 Violence Act , 2005 ‚Äù for various kinds of live - in relationships . The same protection , as per the petitioners , must be accorded to same sex relationships . 17 . It is urged by the learned counsel for the petitioners that individuals belonging to the LGBT group suffer discrimination and abuse throughout their lives due to the existence of Section 377 IPC which is nothing but a manifestation of a mindset of societal values prevalent during the Victorian era where sexual activities were considered mainly for procreation . The said community remains in a constant state of fear which is not conducive for their growth . It is contended that they suffer at the hands of law and are also deprived of the citizenry rights which are protected under the Constitution . The law should have treated them as natural victims and sensitized the society towards their plight and laid stress on such victimisation , however , the reverse is being done due to which a sense of estrangement and alienation has developed and continues to prevail amongst the members belonging to the LGBT group . Compulsory alienation due to stigma and threat is contrary to the fundamental principle of liberty .
