PART K opinions of others , to do so would be wise , or even right ... The only part of the conduct of any one , for which he is amenable to society , is that which concerns others . In the part which merely concerns himself , his independence is , of right , absolute . Over himself , over his own body and mind , the individual is sovereign . ” 52 ° ( Emphasis supplied ) Mill created a dichotomy between “ self - regarding ” actions ( those which affect the individual himself and have no significant effect on society at large ) and “ other - regarding ” actions ( those which affect the society).5 ° ” He was aware that in a way , all actions of an individual are likely to affect “ those nearly connected with him and , in a minor degree , society at large . ’ ° * ® However , he argued that as long as an action does not “ violate a distinct and assignable obligation to any other person or persons ” , it may not be taken out of the selfregarding class of actions . ° ? ° Thus , Mill proposed that “ all that portion of a person ’s life and conduct which affects only himself , or , if it also affects others , only with their free , voluntary , and undeceived consent and participation ” should be free from state interference . ° ° ° He further added that the state and society are not justified in interfering in the self - regarding sphere , merely because they believe certain conduct to be “ foolish , perverse , or wrong . ”39 " $ 26 Ibid . 827 Ibid . 828 Ibid . 329 Ibid . 380 Ibid . 331 Ibid . 155
