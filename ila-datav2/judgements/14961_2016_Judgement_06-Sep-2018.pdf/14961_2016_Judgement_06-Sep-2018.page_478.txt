The Constitutional Court of South Africa in National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality & Anr . v. Minister of Justice & Ors . ( supra ) noted as under : “ Privacy recognises that we all have a right to a sphere of private intimacy and autonomy which allows us to establish and nurture human relationships without interference from the outside community . The way in which we give expression to our sexuality is at the core of this area of private intimacy . If , in expressing our sexuality , we act consensually and without harming one another , invasion of that precinct will be a breach of our privacy . ” Just like other fundamental rights , the right to privacy is not an absolute right and is subject to reasonable restrictions . Any restriction on the right to privacy must adhere to the requirements of legality , existence of a legitimate state interest , and proportionality.+5 A subjective notion of public or societal morality which discriminates against LGBT persons , and subjects them to criminal sanction , simply on the basis of an innate characteristic runs counter to the concept of Constitutional morality , and can not form the basis of a legitimate State interest . 45 K.S. Puttaswamy & Anr . v. Union of India & Ors . , ( 2017 ) 10 SCC 1 , at paragraphs 325 , 638 and 645 35
