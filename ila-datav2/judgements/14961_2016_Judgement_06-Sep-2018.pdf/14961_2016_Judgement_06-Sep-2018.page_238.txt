Instead of the inhumane Section 309 which has remained on the statute book for over 150 years , Section 115 makes it clear that Section 309 is rendered largely ineffective , and on the contrary , instead of committing a criminal offence , any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code . More importantly , the Government has an affirmative duty to provide care , treatment and rehabilitation to such a person to reduce the risk of recurrence of that person ’s attempt to commit suicide . This parliamentary declaration under Section 115 again is in keeping with the present constitutional values , making it clear that humane measures are to be taken by the Government in respect of a person who attempts to commit suicide instead of prosecuting him for the offence of attempt to commit suicide . 77 . And finally , Section 120 of the Act reads as under : “ 120 . Act to have overriding effect . The provisions of this Act shall have overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith 72
