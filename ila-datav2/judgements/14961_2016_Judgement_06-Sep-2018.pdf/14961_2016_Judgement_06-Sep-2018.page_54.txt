54 fit , thrust . ’ Therefore , if the male organ is ‘ inserted ’ or ‘ thrust ’ between the thighs , there is ‘ penetration ’ to constitute unnatural offence . 21 . Unnatural offence is defined in Section 377 of the Penal Code ; whoever voluntarily has _ carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man , woman or animal commits unnatural offence . The act of committing intercourse between the thighs is carnal intercourse against the order of nature . Therefore committing intercourse by inserting the male organ between the thighs of another is an unnatural offence . In this connection , it may be noted that the act in Section 376 is ‘ sexual intercourse ’ and the act in Section 377 is ‘ carnal intercourse against the order of nature ’ . 22 . The position in English law on this question has been brought to my notice . The old decision of R. v. Samuel Jacobs * ' lays down that penetration through the mouth does not amount to the offence of sodomy under English law . The counsel therefore argues that sexual intercourse between the thighs can not also be an offence under Section 377 of the Penal Code . In Sirkar v. Gula Mythien Pillai Chaithu Maho Mathu ® a Full Bench of the Travancore High Court held that having connection with a person in the mouth was an offence under Section 377 of the Penal Code . In a short judgment , the learned Judges held that it was unnecessary to refer to English Statute Law and English text books which proceeded upon an interpretation of the words sodomy , buggery and bestiality ; and that the words used in the Penal Code were very simple and wide enough to include all acts against the order of nature . My view on the question is also that the words of Section 377 are simple and wide enough to include any carnal intercourse against the order of nature within its ambit .
