In Shakti Vahini v. Union of India ' ® * , a three judge Bench of this Court issued directives to prevent honour killings at the behest of Knap Panchayats and protect persons who enter into marriages that do not have the approval of the Panchayats . The Court recognised the right to choose a life partner as a fundamental right under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution .
