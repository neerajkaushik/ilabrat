PART E cost if they did not possess sufficient movable property in India only if they were residing outside India . However , women were responsible for paying such security , regardless of whether or not they were residing in India . In other words , the law drew a distinction between resident males who did not have sufficient immovable property , and resident females who did not have sufficient immovable property . Upholding the provision , the Calcutta High Court held : “ 31 . Article 15(1 ) of the Constitution pro - vides , inter alia , - The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of sex . The word ‘ only ’ in this Article is of great importance and significance which should not be missed . The impugned law must be shown to discriminate because of sex alone . If other factors in addition to sex come into play in making the discriminatory law , then such discrimination does not , in my judgment , come within the provision of Article 15(1 ) of the Constitution . ” | ( Emphasis supplied ) This interpretation was upheld by this Court in Air India v. Nergesh Meerza ( ‘ Nergesh Meerza”).8 Regulations 46 and 47 of the Air India Employees ’ Service Regulations were challenged for causing a disparity between the pay and promotional opportunities of men and women in - flight cabin crew . Under Regulation 46 , while the retirement age for male Flight Pursers was fifty eight , Air Hostesses were required to retire at thirty five , oron marriage ( if they married within four years of joining service ) , oron _ their first pregnancy , whichever occurred earlier . This period could be extended in the 86 ( 1981 ) 4 SCC 335 45
