15 . Stung to the quick , when criticized as to the delay in bringing out the Code , he observed in a Minute to Lord Auckland as follows : “ when | remember the slow progress of law reforms at home and when | consider that our Code decides hundreds of questions ... every one of which if stirred in England would give occasion to voluminous controversy and to many animated debates , | must acknowledge that | am inclined to fear that we have been guilty rather of precipitation than of delay . ” 16 . Earlier , he had described the core objective of his project in his 04.06.1835 Minute to the Council which could be paraphrased as follows : It should be more than a mere digest of existing laws , covering all contingencies , and ‘ nothing that is not in the Code ought to be law ’ . It should suppress crime with the least infliction of suffering and allow for the ascertaining of the truth at the smallest possible cost of time and money . Its language should be clear , unequivocal and concise . Every criminal act should be separately defined , its language followed opprecisely in indictment and conduct found to fall clearly within the definition . Uniformity was to be the chief end and special definitions , procedures or other exceptions to account for different races or sects should not be included without clear and strong reasons .
