“ The Indian Penal Code is to the English criminal law what a manufactured article ready for use is to the materials out of which it is made . It is to the French Penal Code and , | may add , to the North Germany Code of 1871 , what a finished picture is to a sketch . It is far simpler , and much _ better expressed , than Livingston ’s Code for Louisiana ; and its practical success has been complete ” . 13 . He further described the Penal Code as : “ the criminal law of England freed from all technicalities and superfluities , systematically arranged and modified in some few particulars ( they are surprisingly few ) , to suit circumstances of British India . ” 14 . According to Lord Macaulay , a good Code should have the qualities of precision and comprehensibility . In a letter to Lord Auckland , the Governor General of India in Council , which accompanied his draft Penal Code , he stated : “ There are two things which a legislator should always have in view while he is framing laws : the one is that they should be as far as possible precise ; the other that they should be easily understood . That a law , and especially a penal law , should be drawn in words which convey no meaning to the people who are to obey it , is an evil . On the other hand , a loosely worded law is no law , and to whatever extent a _ legislature uses vague expressions , to that extent it abdicates its functions , and resigns the power of making law to the Courts of Justice . ”
