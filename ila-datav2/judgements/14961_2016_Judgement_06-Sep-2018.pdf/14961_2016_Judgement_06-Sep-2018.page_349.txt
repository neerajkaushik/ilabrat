These are the minimum requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no State neither the Central Government nor any State Government - has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) In Consumer Education & Research Centre v.
