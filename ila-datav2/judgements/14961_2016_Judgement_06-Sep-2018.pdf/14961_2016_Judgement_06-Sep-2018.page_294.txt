PART D as ‘ carnal intercourse against the order of nature . ” Yet Koushal upheld the classification of sexual acts in Section 377 without explaining the difference between the classes , or the justification for treating the classes differently . This lack of reasoning and analysis by the Court has been critiqued in scholarly research on the subject . The following extract sums up the criticism with telling effect : “ The Court says — without an iota of evidence — that there are two classes of persons — those who engage in sexual intercourse in the “ ordinary course ” , and those who do n't . What is ordinary course ? Presumably , heterosexuality . Why is this ordinary course ? Perhaps because there are more heterosexuals than homosexuals around , although the Court gives no evidence for that . Well , there are also more blackhaired people in India than brown - haired people . Is sex with a brown - haired person against the order of nature because it happens less often ? ... Where is the rational nexus ? What is the legitimate governmental objective ? Even if we accept that there is an intelligible differentia here , on what basis do you criminalize — and thus deny equal protection of laws — to one class of persons ? The Court gives no answer . Alternatively , “ ordinary sex ” is penal - vaginal , and every other kind of sex is “ against the ordinary course of nature ” . Again , no evidence to back that claim up apart from the say - so of the judge . ”6 ° At the very outset , we must understand the problem with the usage of the term ‘ order of nature ’ . What is ‘ natural ’ and what is ‘ unnatural ’ ? And who decides the categorization into these two ostensibly distinct and water - tight compartments ? Do we allow the state to draw the boundaries between 58 Koushal , at para 60 . 60 Gautam Bhatia , “ The Unbearable Wrongness of Koushal vs Naz Foundation ” , Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy ( 2013 ) . 32
