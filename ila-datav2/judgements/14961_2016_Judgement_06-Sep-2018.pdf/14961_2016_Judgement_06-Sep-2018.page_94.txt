Homosexuality is neither mental illness nor moral depravity . It is simply the way a minority of our population expresses human love and sexuality . Study after study documents the mental health of gay men and lesbians . Studies of judgment , stability , reliability , and social and vocational adaptiveness all show that gay men and lesbians function every bit as well as heterosexuals . Nor _ is homosexuality a_matter_of individual__choice . Research suggests _ that _ the homosexual orientation is in place very early in the life cycle , possibly even before birth . It is found in about ten percent of the population , a figure which is surprisingly constant_across cultures , irrespective of the different moral values and standards of a particular culture . Contrary to what some imply , the incidence of homosexuality in _ a _ population does not appear to change with new moral codes or social mores . Research findings suggest that efforts to repair homosexuals are nothing more than social prejudice garbed in psychological accouterments .
