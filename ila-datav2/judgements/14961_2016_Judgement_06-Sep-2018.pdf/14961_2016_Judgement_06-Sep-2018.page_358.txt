PART G coercion , violence , and discrimination of any kind — to the highest attainable standard of sexual health ; to pursue a satisfying , safe , and pleasurable sexual life ; to have control over and decide freely , and with due regard for the rights of others , on matters related to their sexuality , reproduction , sexual orientation , bodily integrity , choice of partner , and gender identity ; and to the services , education , and information , including comprehensive sexuality education , necessary to do so . ” The discussion of ‘ sexual rights ’ ( as they pertain to sexuality and sexual orientation ) within the framework of the right to health is a relatively new phenomenon:'% “ Before the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna , and the subsequent 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo , sexuality , sexual rights , and sexual diversity had not formed part of the international health and human rights discourse . These newly emerged “ sexual rights ” were founded on the principles of bodily integrity , personhood , equality , and diversity . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 76 The operation of Section 377 denies consenting adults the full realization of their right to health , as well as their sexual rights . It forces consensual sex between adults into a realm of fear and shame , as persons who engage in anal and oral intercourse risk criminal sanctions if they seek health advice . This lowers the standard of health enjoyed by them and particularly by members of sexual and gender minorities , in relation to the rest of society . 194 Supra note 185 , at pages 195 - 208 . 195 Supra note 185 , at pages 195 - 208 . 96
