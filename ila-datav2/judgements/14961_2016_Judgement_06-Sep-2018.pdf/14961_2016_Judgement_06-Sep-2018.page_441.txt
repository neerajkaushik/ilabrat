PART M 153 Above all , this case has had great deal to say on the dialogue about the transformative power of the Constitution . In addressing LGBT rights , the Constitution speaks — as well — to the rest of society . In recognising the rights of the LGBT community , the Constitution asserts itself as a text for governance which promotes true equality . It does so by questioning prevailing notions about the dominance of sexes and genders . In its transformational role , the Constitution directs our attention to resolving the polarities of sex and binarities of gender . In dealing with these issues we confront much that polarises our society . Our ability to survive as a free society will depend upon whether constitutional values can prevail over the impulses of the time . 154 A hundred and fifty eight years is too long a period for the LGBT community to suffer the indignities of denial . That it has taken sixty eight years even after the advent of the Constitution is a sobering reminder of the unfinished task which lies ahead . It is also a time to invoke the transformative power of the Constitution . 155 The ability of a society to acknowledge the injustices which it has perpetuated is a mark of its evolution . In the process of remedying wrongs under a regime of constitutional remedies , recrimination gives way to restitution , diatribes pave the way for dialogue and healing replaces the hate 179
