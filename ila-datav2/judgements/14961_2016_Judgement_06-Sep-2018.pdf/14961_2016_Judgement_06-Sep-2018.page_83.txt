83 of our country have solemnly dealt with the task of assuring and preserving the right to dignity of each and every individual whenever the occasion arises , for without the right to live with dignity , all other fundamental rights may not realise their complete meaning . 128 . To understand a person ’s dignity , one has to appreciate how the dignity of another is to be perceived . Alexis de Tocqueville tells us ” * : “ Whenever | find myself in the presence of another human being , of whatever station , my dominant feeling is not so much to serve him or please him as not to offend his dignity . ” 129 . Every individual has many possessions which assume the position of his / her definitive characteristics . There may not be any obsession with them but he / she may abhor to be denuded of them , for they are sacred to him / her and so inseparably associated that he / she may not conceive of any dissolution . He / she would like others to respect the said attributes with a singular acceptable condition that there is mutual respect . Mutual respect abandons outside interference and is averse to any kind of interdiction . It is based on the precept that the individuality of an individual is recognized , accepted and respected . Such respect for the conception of dignity 5556 , New York State Bar Journal ( No 3 . April , 1984 ) , p.50
