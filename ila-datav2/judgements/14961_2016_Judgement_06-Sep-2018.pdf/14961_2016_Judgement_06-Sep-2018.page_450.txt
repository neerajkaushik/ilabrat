( emphasis supplied ) 9.In 1957 , the United Kingdom published the Wolfenden Committee Report ( supra ) which recognised how the antisodomy laws had created an atmosphere for blackmail , harassment and violence against homosexuals . An extract of the findings of this Committee reads as under : “ We have found it hard to decide whether the blackmailer ’s primary weapon is the threat of disclosure to the police , with attendant legal consequences , or the threat of disclosure to the victim ’s relatives , employers or friends , with attendant social consequences . It may well be that the latter is the more effective weapon , but it may yet be true that it would lose much of its edge if the social consequences were not associated with the present legal position . ” Pursuant to this Report , the House of Lords initiated legislation to de - criminalise homosexual acts done in private by consenting parties . The Sexual Offences Act , 1967 came to be passed in England which de - criminalised homosexual acts done in private , provided the parties had consented to it , and were above the age of 21 . 10 . The trend of decriminalizing anti - sodomy laws world over has gained currency during the past few decades since such laws have been recognised to be violative of human rights . In
