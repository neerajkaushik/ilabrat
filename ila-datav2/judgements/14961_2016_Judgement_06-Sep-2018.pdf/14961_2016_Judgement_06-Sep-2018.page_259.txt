Section 377 continues to penalize such sexual intercourse , an anomalous position would result . A man indulging in such sexual intercourse would not be liable to be prosecuted for rape but would be liable to be prosecuted under Section 377 . Further , a woman who could , at no point of time , have been prosecuted for rape would , despite her consent , be prosecuted for indulging in anal or such other sexual intercourse with a man in private under Section 377 . This would render Section 377 , as applied to such consenting adults , as manifestly arbitrary as it would be wholly excessive and disproportionate to prosecute such persons under Section 377 when the legislature has amended one portion of the law in 2013 , making it clear that consensual sex , as described in the amended provision , between two consenting adults , one a man and one a woman , would not be liable for prosecution . If , by having regard to what has been said above , Section 377 has to be read down as not applying to anal and such other sex by a male - female couple , then the Section will continue to apply only to homosexual sex . If this be the case , the Section will offend Article 14 as it will discriminate between heterosexual and 93
