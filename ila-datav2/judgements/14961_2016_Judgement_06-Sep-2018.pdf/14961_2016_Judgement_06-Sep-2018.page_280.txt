PART C does not understand . The world mocks at it , and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it . ”2 ” Wilde was held guilty and was sentenced to two years ’ hard labour and subsequently incarcerated . Following World War Il , arrests and prosecutions of homosexuals increased . Alan Turing , the renowned mathematician and cryptographer who was responsible for breaking the Nazi Enigma code during World War II , was convicted of ‘ gross indecency ’ in 1952 . In order to avoid a prison sentence , Turing was forced to agree to chemical castration . He was injected with synthetic female hormones . Less than two years after he began the hormone treatment , Turing committed suicide . The Amendment Act ( also known as the Labouchere Amendment ) remained in English law until 1967 . Turing was posthumously pardoned in 2013 , and in 2017 , the UK introduced the Policing and Crime Bill , also called the “ Turing Law , ” posthumously pardoning 50,000 homosexual men and providing pardons for the living . In the wake of several court cases in which homosexuality had been featured , the British Parliament in 1954 set up the Wolfenden Committee , headed by 27 H. Montgomery Hyde , John O'Connor , and Merlin Holland , The Trials of Oscar Wilde ( 2014 ) , at page 201 . 18
