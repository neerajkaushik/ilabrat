PART G 77 The right to health is not simply the right not to be unwell , but rather the right to be well . It encompasses not just the absence of disease or infirmity , but “ complete physical , mental and social well being’,'9 ° and includes both freedoms such as the right to control one ’s health and body and to be free from interference ( for instance , from non - consensual medical treatment and experimentation ) , and entitlements such as the right to a system of healthcare that gives everyone an equal opportunity to enjoy the highest attainable level of health . 78 The jurisprudence of this Court , in recognizing the right to health and access to medical care , demonstrates the crucial distinction between negative and positive obligations . Article 21 does not impose upon the State only negative obligations not to act in such a way as to interfere with the right to health . This Court also has the power to impose positive obligations upon the State to take measures to provide adequate resources or access to treatment facilities to secure effective enjoyment of the right to health.19 ” 79 A study of sexuality and its relationship to the right to health in South Africa points to several other studies that suggest a negative correlation between sexual orientation - based discrimination and the right to health : 196 Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organisation . 197 Jayna Kothari , “ Social Rights and the Indian Constitution ’ , Law , Social Justice and Global Development Journal ( 2004 ) . 97
