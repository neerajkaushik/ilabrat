PART M 150 Sexual and gender based minorities can not live in fear , if the Constitution has to have meaning for them on even terms . In its quest for equality and the equal protection of the law , the Constitution guarantees to them an equal citizenship . In de - criminalising such conduct , the values of the Constitution assure to the LGBT community the ability to lead a life of freedom from fear and to find fulfilment in intimate choices . 151 . The choice of a partner , the desire for personal intimacy and the yearning to find love and fulfilment in human relationships have a universal appeal , straddling age and time . In protecting consensual intimacies , the Constitution adopts a simple principle : the state has no business to intrude into these personal matters . Nor can societal notions of heteronormativity regulate constitutional liberties based on sexual orientation . 152 This reference to the Constitution Bench is about the validity of Section 377 in its application to consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex . The constitutional principles which we have invoked to determine the outcome address the origins of the rights claimed and the source of their protection . In their range and content , those principles address issues broader than the acts which the statute penalises . Resilient and universal as they are , these constitutional values must enure with a mark of permanence . 178
