Â° to highlight that the emphasis for individual 's freedom to conduct his sex life and personal relationships as he wishes , subject to the permitted exceptions , countervails public interest . 11 . The further submission that was advanced by Mr. Datar was that privacy of the individual having been put on such a high pedestal and sexual orientation having been emphasized in the NALSA case , Section 377 IPC can not be construed as a reasonable restriction as that would have the potentiality to destroy the individual autonomy and sexual orientation . It is an accepted principle of interpretation of statutes that a provision does not become unconstitutional merely because there can be abuse of the same . Similarly , though a provision on the statute book is not invoked on many occasions , yet it does not fall into the sphere of the doctrine of desuetude . However , Suresh Koushal 's case has been guided by the aforesaid doctrine of desuetude . 5 [ 2008 ] EWHC 1777 ( QB )
