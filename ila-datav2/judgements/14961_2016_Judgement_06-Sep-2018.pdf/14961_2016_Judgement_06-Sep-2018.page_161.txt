( ix ) 161 be extended for the benefit of the majority only and that the Courts ought to interfere only when the fundamental rights of a large percentage of the total populace is affected . In fact , the said view would be completely against the constitutional ethos , for the language employed in Part Ill of the Constitution as well as the intention of the framers of our Constitution mandates that the Courts must step in whenever there is a violation of the fundamental rights , even if the right / s of a single individual is / are in peril . There is a manifest ascendance of rights under the Constitution which paves the way for the doctrine of progressive realization of rights as such rights evolve with the evolution of the society . This doctrine , as a natural corollary , gives birth to the doctrine of non - retrogression , as per which there must not be atavism of constitutional rights . In the light of the same , if we were to accept the view in Suresh Koushal ( supra ) , it would tantamount to a retrograde step in the direction of the progressive interpretation of the Constitution and denial of progressive realization of rights .
