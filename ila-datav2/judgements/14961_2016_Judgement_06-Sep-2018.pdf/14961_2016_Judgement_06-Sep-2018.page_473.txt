The expression of sexuality requires a partner , real or imagined . It is not for the state _ to choose _ or arrange the choice of partner , but for the partners to choose themselves . ”      ( emphasis supplied ) Section 377 insofar as it curtails the personal liberty of LGBT persons to engage in voluntary consensual sexual relationships with a partner of their choice , in a safe and dignified environment , is violative of Article 21 . It inhibits them from entering and nurturing enduring relationships . As a result , LGBT individuals are forced to either lead a life of solitary existence without a companion , or lead a closeted life as “ unapprehended felons ” 38 Section 377 criminalises the entire class of LGBT persons since sexual intercourse between such persons , is considered to be carnal and “ against the order of nature ” . Section 377 prohibits LGBT persons from engaging in intimate sexual relations in private . 38 According to Professor Edwin Cameron , LGBT persons are reduced to the status of “ unapprehended felons ” owing to the ever - so - present threat of prosecution .
