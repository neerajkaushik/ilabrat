PART C drew inspiration from the English common law and the British Royal Commission ’s 1843 Draft Code . ° Tracing that origin , English jurist Fitzjames Stephen observes : “ The Indian Penal Code may be described as the criminal law of England freed from all technicalities and superfluities , systematically arranged and modified in some few particulars ( they are surprisingly few ) to suit the circumstances of British India . ”1 ° In order to understand the colonial origins of Section 377 , it is necessary to go further back to modern English law ’s conception of anal and oral intercourse , which was firmly rooted in Judeo - Christian morality and condemned nonprocreative sex . ' ' Though Jesus himself does not reference homosexuality or homosexual sex , ' ? the “ Holiness Code ” ' ? found in Leviticus provides thus : “ You shall not lie with a male as with a woman . It is an abomination . [ 18:22 ] If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them . [ 19:13 ] If aman lies with a male as with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination ; they shall be put to death , their blood is upon them . [ 20:13 ] ° Douglas E.
