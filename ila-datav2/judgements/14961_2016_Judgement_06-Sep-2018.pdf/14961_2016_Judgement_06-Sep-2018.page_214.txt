146 . The decision in Koushal [ Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation , ( 2014 ) 1 SCC 1 ( 2013 ) 4 SCC ( Cri ) 1 ] presents a de minimis rationale when it asserts that there have been only two hundred prosecutions for violating Section 377 . The de minimis hypothesis is misplaced because the invasion of a fundamental right is not rendered tolerable when a few , as opposed to a large number of persons , are subjected to hostile treatment . The reason why such acts of hostile discrimination are constitutionally impermissible is because of the chilling effect which they have on the exercise of the fundamental right in the first place . For instance , pre - publication restraints such as censorship are vulnerable because they discourage people from exercising their right to free speech because of the fear of a restraint coming into operation . The chilling effect on the exercise of the right poses a grave danger to the unhindered fulfilment of one 's sexual orientation , as an element of privacy and dignity . The chilling effect is due to the danger of a human being subjected to social opprobrium or disapproval , as reflected in the punishment of crime . Hence the Koushal [ Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation , ( 2014 ) 1 SCC 1 : ( 2013 ) 4 SCC ( Cri ) 1 ] rationale that prosecution of a few is not an index of violation is flawed and can not be accepted . Consequently , we disagree with the manner in which Koushal [ Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation , ( 2014 ) 1 SCC 1 : ( 2013 ) 4 SCC ( Cri ) 1 ] has dealt with the privacy - dignity based claims of LGBT persons on this aspect . 147 . Since the challenge to Section 377 is pending consideration before a larger Bench of this Court , we would leave the constitutional validity to be decided in an appropriate proceeding . ‚Äù 48
