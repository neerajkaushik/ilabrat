PART G “ For example , in a Canadian study , Brotman and colleagues found that being open about their sexual orientation in health care settings contributed to experiences of discrimination for lesbian , gay , and bisexual people . ”!98 “ Lane and colleagues interviewed men who have sex with men in Soweto , and revealed that all men who disclosed their sexual orientation at public health facilities had experienced some form of discrimination . Such discrimination [ ‘ ranging from verbal abuse to denial of care’'% ] , and also the anticipation thereof , leads to delays when seeking sexual health services such as HIV counseling and testing . ”2 ° 80 Alexandra Muller describes the story of two individuals who experienced such discrimination . T , a gay man , broke both his arms while fleeing from a group of people that attacked him because of his sexuality . At the hospital , the staff learned about T ’s sexual orientation , and pejoratively discussed it in his presence . He also had to endure “ a local prayer group that visited the ward daily to provide spiritual support to patients ” which “ prayed at his bedside to rectify his “ devious ” sexuality . When he requested that they leave , or that he be transferred to another ward , the nurses did not intervene , and the prayer group visited regularly to continue to recite their homophobic prayers . T did not file an official complaint , fearing future ramifications in accessing care . Following his discharge , he decided not to return for follow up appointments and had his casts removed at another facility.2 ° ' 198 Supra note 185 , at pages 195 - 208 . 199 Ibid . 200 Ibid . 201 Ibid . 98
