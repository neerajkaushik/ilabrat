JUDGMENT R.F. Nariman , J. 1 . “ The love that dare not speak its name ” is how the love that exists between same - sex couples was described by Lord Alfred Douglas , the lover of Oscar Wilde , in his poem Two Loves published in 1894 in Victorian England . 2 . The word “ homosexual ” is not derived from “ homo ” meaning man , but from “ homo ” meaning same . ' The word “ lesbian ” is derived from the name of the Greek island of Lesbos , where it was rumored that female same - sex couples proliferated . What we have before us is a relook at the constitutional validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which was enacted in the year 1860 ( over 150 years ago ) insofar as it criminalises consensual sex between adult same sex couples . 3 . | These cases have had a chequered history . Writ petitions were filed before the Delhi High Court challenging the 1 Homo in Greek means ‘ same ’ — the Nicene creed that was accepted by the Catholic Church after the Council at Nicaea , held by Emperor Constantine in 325 AD , was formulated with the word ‘ homo ’ at the forefront . When coupled with ‘ sios ’ it means same substance , meaning thereby that Jesus Christ was divine as he was of the same substance as God . 2
