O’Connor concurred in the judgment but side - stepped rather than overruled Bowers ( supra ) . Justice Scalia , with whom the Chief Justice and Justice Thomas joined , found no reason to undo the Bowers ( supra ) verdict stating that stare decisis should carry the day . An interesting passage in Justice Scalia ’s judgment reads as follows : “ Let me be clear that | have nothing against homosexuals , or any other group , promoting their agenda through normal democratic means . Social perceptions of sexual and other morality change over time , and every group has the right to persuade its fellow citizens that its view of such matters is the best . That homosexuals have achieved some success in that enterprise is attested to by the fact that Texas is one of the few remaining States that criminalize private , consensual homosexual acts . But persuading one ’s fellow citizens is one thing , and imposing one ’s views in absence of democratic majority will is something else . | would no more require a State to criminalize homosexual acts — or , for that matter , display any moral disapprobation of them — than | would forbid it to do so . What Texas has chosen to do is well within the range of traditional democratic action , and its hand should not be stayed through the invention of a brand - new “ constitutional right ” by a Court that is impatient of democratic change . It is indeed true that “ later generations can see that laws once    assembly , and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote ; they depend on the outcome of no elections . ” And finally , it was held:‘If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation , it is that no official , high or petty , can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics , nationalism , religion , or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein . If there are any circumstances which permit an exception , they do not now occur to us . ” 26
