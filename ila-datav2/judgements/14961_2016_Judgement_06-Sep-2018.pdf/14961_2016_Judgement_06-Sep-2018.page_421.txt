PART K 2 . If society has the right to pass judgment , has it also the right to use the weapon of the law to enforce it?”o44 Devlin believed that society depends upon a common morality for its stability and existence.2 * ° On the basis of this belief , Devlin answered the above questions in the affirmative , stating that — society has the right to pass judgments on all matters of morality and also the right to use law to enforce such morality.*4 ° Devlin reasoned that society would disintegrate if a common morality was not observed . Therefore , society is justified in taking steps to preserve its morality as much as it preserves the government.*4 ” Devlin proposed that the common morality or “ collective judgment of the society ” should be ascertained taking into consideration the “ reasonable man . ”948 According to him , a reasonable man is an ordinary man whose judgment “ may largely be a matter of feeling . ” ° 4 ° He added that if the reasonable man believed a practice to be immoral , and held this belief honestly and dispassionately , then for the purpose of law such practice should be considered immoral.2 ° ° 344 Sir Patrick Arthur Devlin , “ The Enforcement Of Morals ” Oxford University Press ( 1959 ) at page 9 . 545 Supra note 334 , at page 662 . 346 Animesh Sharma , “ Section 377 : No Jurisprudential Basis . ” Economic and Political Weekly , Vol . 43 ( 2008 ) at pages 12 - 14 . 347 Supra note 344 . 548 Ibid . 549 Ibid . 359 Ibid . 159
