judgment , stability , reliability , or general social or vocational capabilities . ” Am . Psychiatric Ass'n , Position Statement on Homosexuality and Civil Rights ( Dec. 15 , 1973 ) , printed in 131 Am . J. Psychiatry 497 ( 1974 ) . That decision was upheld by a vote of the Psychiatric Association ’s membership the following year . After a thorough review of the scientific evidence , amicus American Psychological Association adopted the same position in 1975 , and urged all mental health professionals to help dispel the stigma of mental illness that had long been associated with homosexual orientation . See Am . Psychol . Ass’n , Minutes of the Annual Meeting of the Council of Representatives , 30 Am . Psychologist 620 , 633 ( 1975 ) . Amicus National Association of Social Workers ( NASW ) has adopted a similar policy . See NASW , Policy Statement on Lesbian and Gay Issues ( Aug. 1993 ) ( approved by NASW Delegate Assembly ) , reprinted in NASW , Social Work Speaks : NASW Policy Statements 162 ( 3d ed . 1994 ) . Of course , as is the case for heterosexuals , some homosexuals have mental illnesses , psychological disturbances , or poor social adjustment . Gay men , lesbians , and bisexuals also may be at somewhat greater risk for some kinds of psychological problems because of stresses associated with the experiences of social stigma and prejudice ( see pp . 23 - 27 , infra ) .
