PART H The power to enact legislation in the field of criminal law has been entrusted to Parliament and , subject to its authority , to the State Legislatures . Both Parliament and the State Legislatures can enact laws providing for offences arising out of legislation falling within their legislative domains . The authority to enact law , however , is subject to the validity of the law being scrutinised on the touchstone of constitutional safeguards . A citizen , or , as in the present case , a community of citizens , having addressed a challenge to the validity of a law which creates an offence , the authority to determine that question is entrusted to the judicial branch in the exercise of the power of judicial review . The Court will not , as it does not , in the exercise of judicial review , second guess a value judgment made by the legislature on the need for or the efficacy of legislation . But where a law creating an offence is found to be offensive to fundamental rights , such a law is not immune to challenge . The constitutional authority which is entrusted to the legislatures to create offences is subject to the mandate of a written Constitution . Where the validity of the law is called into question , judicial review will extend to scrutinising whether the law is manifestly arbitrary in its encroachment on fundamental liberties . If a law discriminates against a group or a community of citizens by denying them full and equal participation as citizens , in the rights and liberties granted by the Constitution , it would be for the Court to adjudicate upon validity of such a law . 112
