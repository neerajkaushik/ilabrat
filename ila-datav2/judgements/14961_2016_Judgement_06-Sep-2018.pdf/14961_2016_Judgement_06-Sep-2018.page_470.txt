under Article 21 of the Constitution , so as _ to comprehend the true scope and contours of the right to life under Article 21 . Article 21 is “ the most precious human right and forms the ark of all other rights ” as held in Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator , Union Territory of Delhi & Ors . ,32 wherein it was noted that the right to life could not be restricted to a mere animal existence , and provided for much more than only physical survival.33 Bhagwati J. observed as under : “ 8 ... We think that the right _ to life includes the right to live with human dignity and _ all that goes along with it , namely the bare necessaries of life such_as _ adequate nutrition , clothing and_shelter and facilities for reading , writing and_expressing oneself in diverse forms , freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings ... it must in any view of the matter , include the right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and_activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the human - self . Every act which offends against or impairs human dignity would constitute deprivation pro tanto of this right to live and it would have to be in accordance with reasonable , fair and just procedure established by law which stands the test of other fundamental rights . ” ( emphasis supplied )              32 ( 1981 ) 1 SCC 608 33 ( 1981 ) 1 SCC 608 at paragraph 7 27
