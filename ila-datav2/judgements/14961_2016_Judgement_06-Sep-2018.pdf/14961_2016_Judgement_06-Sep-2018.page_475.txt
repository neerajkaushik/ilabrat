â€œ To say that the issue in Bowers was simply the right to engage in certain sexual conduct demeans the claim the individual put forward , just as it would demean a married couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the right to have sexual intercourse ... ... It suffices for us to acknowledge that adults may choose to enter upon this relationship in the confines of their homes and their own private lives and still retain their dignity as free persons . When sexuality finds overt expression in intimate conduct with another person , the conduct can be but one element in_a personal bond _ that_is more enduring . The liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to make this choice ... This stigma this criminal statute imposes , moreover , is not trivial . The offence , to be sure , is but a class C misdemeanour , a minor offence in the Texas legal system . Still , it remains a criminal offence with all that imports for the dignity of the persons charged . The petitioners will bear on their record the history of criminal convictions ... ... The present case does not involve minors . It does not involve persons who might be injured or coerced or who are situated in relationships where consent might not easily be refused . It does not involve public conduct or prostitution . It does not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexuals persons seek to enter . The case does involve two adults who , with full_and_mutual_consent_from each other , engage in sexual practices , common to a homosexual lifestyle . The Petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives . The State can not demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime . The right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them_the_full_right_to engage in _ their_conduct without intervention of the government . It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which _ the_government_may_not enter . Casey , supra at 847 . The Texas statute                                  32
