The applicant has contended that if the prayers of the petitioners herein are allowed , it would amount to judicial legislation , for the Courts can not add or delete words into a statute . It is stated that the words ' consent ' and/or ‘ without consent ' are not mentioned in Section 377 IPC and , therefore , the Courts can not make such an artificial distinction .

The applicant has also drawn the attention of this Court to the decision in Union of India and another v. Deoki Nandan Aggarwal ” wherein it was observed that the Court can not rewrite , 24(2004 ) 5 SCC 518 251992 Supp . ( 1 ) SCC 323
