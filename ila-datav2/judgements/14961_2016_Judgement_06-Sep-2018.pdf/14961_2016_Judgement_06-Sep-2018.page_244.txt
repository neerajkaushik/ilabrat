would clearly be violated . The object sought to be achieved by the provision , namely to enforce Victorian mores upon the citizenry of India , would be out of tune with the march of constitutional events that has since taken place , rendering the said object itself discriminatory when it seeks to single out same - sex couples and transgenders for punishment . 83 . As has been stated in the judgment of Nariman , J. in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India , ( 2015 ) 5 SCC 1 , the chilling effect caused by such a provision would also violate a privacy right under Article 19(1)(a ) , which can by no stretch of imagination be said to be a reasonable restriction in the interest of decency or morality ( See paragraphs 87 to 94 ) . 84 . We may hasten to add , that the Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity discussed below , which were also referred to by Radhakrishnan , J. in NALSA ( supra ) , conform to our constitutional view of the fundamental rights of the citizens of India and persons who come to this Court . 78
