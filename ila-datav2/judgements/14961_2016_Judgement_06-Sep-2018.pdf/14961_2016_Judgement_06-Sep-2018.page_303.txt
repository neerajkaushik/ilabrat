PART D excluded from criminal liability when they take place in the course of consensual heterosexual contact . Parliament has ruled against them being regarded against the ‘ order of nature ’ , in the context of Section 375 . Yet those acts continue to be subject to criminal liability , if two adult men or women were to engage in consensual sexual contact . This is a violation of Article 14 . Nivedita Menon opposes the idea that ‘ normal ’ sexuality springs from nature and argues that this idea of ‘ normal ’ sexuality is a cultural and social construct : ” ? “ Consider the possibility that rules of sexual conduct are as arbitrary as traffic rules , created by human societies to maintain a certain sort of order , and which could differ from place to place -- for example , you drive on the left in India and on the right in the USA . Further , let us say you question the sort of social order that traffic rules keep in place . Say you believe that traffic rules in Delhi are the product of a model of urban planning that privileges the rich and penalizes the poor , that this order encourages petrol - consuming private vehicles and discourages forms of transport that are energy - saving -cycles , public transport , pedestrians . You would then question that model of the city that forces large numbers of inhabitants to travel long distances every day simply to get to school andwork . You could debate the merits of traffic rules and urban planning on the grounds of convenience , equity and sustainability of natural resources -- at least , nobody could seriously argue that any set of traffic rules is natural . ” 32 ‘ The struggle of citizens belonging to sexual minorities is located within the larger history of the struggles against various forms of social subordination 79 Nivedita Menon , “ How Natural is Normal ?
