PART D permissible and impermissible intimacies between consenting adults ? Homosexuality has been documented in almost 1500 species , who “ unfortunately are not blessed with rational capabilities ( and the propensity to ‘ nurture ’ same sex thoughts ) as are found in mankind . ” ® ' An interesting article in this regard notes that , “ no species has been found in which homosexual behaviour has not been shown to exist , with the exception of species that never have sex at all , such as sea urchins and aphis . ” © 29 ‘ In an incisive article , “ ? Ambrosino discusses the shift from reproductive instinct to erotic desire and how crucial this shift is to understanding modern notions of sexuality . He analyses how the lines between homosexuality and heterosexuality are blurred , and perhaps even an outdated myth or invention when we understand the fluidity of sexual identities today : ® * “ No one knows exactly why heterosexuals and homosexuals ought to be different , ” wrote Wendell Ricketts , author of the 1984 study Biological Research on Homosexuality . The best answer we 've got is something of a tautology : “ heterosexuals and homosexuals are considered different because they can be divided into two groups on the basis of the belief that they can be divided into two groups . ” Though the hetero / homo divide seems like an eternal , indestructible fact of nature , it simply is n’t . It 's merely one recent grammar humans have invented to talk about what sex means to us . ” 61 Shamnad Basheer , Sroyon Mukherjee and Karthy Nair , “ Section 377 and the ‘ Order of Nature ’ : Nurturing ‘ Indeterminacy ’ in the Law ’ , NUJS Law Review , Vol , 2 ( 2009 ) . 62 Bruce Bagemihl , Biological Exuberance : Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity , Stonewall Inn Editions ( 2000 ) . 63 Brandon Ambrosino , “ The Invention of Heterosexuality ’ , British Broadcasting Company , 26 March , 2017 . 64 Ibid . 33
