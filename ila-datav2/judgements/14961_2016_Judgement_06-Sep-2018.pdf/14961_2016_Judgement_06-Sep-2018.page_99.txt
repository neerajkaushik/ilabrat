99 " Perhaps the best and most succinct legal definition of privacy is that given by Warren and Brandeis - it is " the right to be let alone " . " 154 . In R. Rajagopal v. State of Tamil Nadu and others Â® , while discussing the concept of right to privacy , it has been observed that the right to privacy is implicit in the right to life and liberty guaranteed to the citizens of this country by Article 21 and it is a " right to be let alone " , for a citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his / her own , his / her family , marriage , procreation , motherhood , child - bearing and education , among other matters . 155 . The above authorities capture the essence of the right to privacy . There can be no doubt that an individual also has a right toa union under Article 21 of the Constitution . When we say union , we do not mean the union of marriage , though marriage is a union . As a concept , union also means companionship in every sense of the word , be it physical , mental , sexual or emotional . The LGBT community is seeking realisation of its basic right to companionship , so long as such a companionship is consensual , free from the vice of deceit , force , coercion and does not result in violation of the fundamental rights of others . 85 ( 1994 ) 6 SCC 632
