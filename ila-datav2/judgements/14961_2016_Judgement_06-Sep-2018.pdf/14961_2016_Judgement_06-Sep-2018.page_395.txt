PART J engage in consensual sexual activity in private , and include the right to full citizenship , the right to form unions and the right to family life . 116 Israel was one of the first countries to recognize the rights of homosexuals against discrimination in matters of employment . In EI - Al Israel Airlines Ltd v. Jonathan Danielwitz ( “ El - Al Israel Airlines ” ) ? ’ ? , the Supreme Court of Israel considered an airline company ’s policy of giving discounted tickets to their employees and a ‘ companion recognized as the husband / wife of the employee ’ . This benefit was also given to a partner with whom the employee was living together like husband and wife , but not married . However , the airline refused to give the discounted tickets to the Respondent and his male partner . The Supreme Court of Israel observed thus : “ The principle of equality demands that the existence of a rule that treats people differently is justified by the nature and substance of the issue ... therefore , a particular law will create discrimination when two individuals who are different from one another ( factual inequality ) , are treated differently by the law , even though the factual difference between them does not justify different treatment in the circumstances . ”273 ( Emphasis supplied ) 272 HCJ 721/94 . 273 EI - A Israel Airlines , at para 14 . 133
