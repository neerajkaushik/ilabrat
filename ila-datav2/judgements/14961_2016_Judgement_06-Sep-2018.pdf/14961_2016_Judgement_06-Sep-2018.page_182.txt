“ 54 . As regards the first of these arguments , it is held that conduct of this kind is a cause of the demoralization and decay of civilisations , and that therefore , unless we wish to see our nation degenerate and decay , such conduct must be stopped , by every possible means . We have found no evidence to support this view , and we can not feel it right to frame the laws which should govern this country in the present age by reference to hypothetical explanations of the history of other peoples in ages distant in time and different in circumstances from our own . In so far as the basis of this argument can be precisely formulated , it is often no more than the expression of revulsion against what is regarded as unnatural , sinful or disgusting . Many people feel this revulsion , for one or more of these reasons . But moral conviction or instinctive feeling , however strong , is not a valid basis for overriding the individual ’s privacy and for bringing within the ambit of the criminal law private sexual behaviour of this kind . It is held also that if such men are employed in certain professions or certain branches of the public service their private habits may render them liable to threats of blackmail or to other pressures which may make them “ bad security risks . ” If this is true , it is true also of some other categories of persons : for example , drunkards , gamblers and those who become involved in compromising situations of a heterosexual kind ; and while it may be a valid ground for excluding from certain forms of employment men who indulge in homosexual behaviour , it does not , in our view , constitute a sufficient reason for making their private sexual behaviour an offence in itself . ” ( Emphasis supplied ) 16
