During the Protestant Reformation , these laws shifted from the ecclesiastical to the criminal domain , beginning with Germany in 1532.7 ° While ecclesiastical laws against homosexual intercourse were well established in England by the 1500s,2 ! England ’s first criminal ( nonecclesiastical ) law was the Buggery Act of 1533 , which condemned “ the detestable and abominable vice of buggeri committed with mankind or beest . ”2 * “ Buggery ” is derived from the old French word for heretic , “ bougre ” , and was taken to mean anal intercourse.2 ° 17 The Buggery Act , 1533 , which was enacted by Henry VIII , made the offence of buggery punishable by death , and continued to exist for nearly 300 years before it was repealed and replaced by the Offences against the Person Act , 1828 . Buggery , however , remained a capital offence in England until 1861 , one year after the enactment of the IPC . The language of Section 377 David F. Greenberg and Marcia H.
