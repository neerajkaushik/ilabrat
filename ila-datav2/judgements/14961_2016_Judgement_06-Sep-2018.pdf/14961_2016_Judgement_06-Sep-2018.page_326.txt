PART E 50 Out of twenty Petitioners , sixteen are gay , two are bisexual women and one is a bisexual man . One among the Petitioners is a transwoman . Three of the Petitioners explain that they suffered immense mental agony due to which they were on the verge of committing suicide . Another two stated that speaking about their sexual identity has been difficult , especially since they did not have the support of their families , who , upon learning of their sexual orientation , took them for psychiatric treatment to cure the so - called “ disease . ” The families of three Petitioners ignored their sexual identity . One of them qualified to become an Indian Administrative Services officer in an examination which more than 4,00,000 people write each year . But he chose to forgo his dream because of the fear that he would be discriminated against on the ground of his sexuality . Some of them have experienced depression ; others faced problems focusing on their studies while growing up ; one among them was forced to drop out of high school as she was residing in a girl ’s hostel where the authorities questioned her identity . The parents of one of them brushed his sexuality under the carpet and suggested that he marry a woman . Some doubted whether or not they should continue their relationships given the atmosphere created by Section 377 . Several work in organisations that have policies protecting the LGBT community in place . Having faced so much pain in their personal lives , the Petitioners submit that with the continued operation of Section 377 , such treatment will be unabated . 64
