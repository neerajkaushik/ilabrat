legally permissible acts which were formerly unlawful , is open to criticisms which might not be made in relation to a proposal to omit , from a code of laws being formulated de novo , any provision making these acts illegal . To reverse a _ longstanding tradition is a serious matter and not to be suggested lightly . But the task entrusted to us , as we conceive it , is to state what we regard as a just and equitable law . We therefore do not think it appropriate that consideration of this question should be unduly influenced by a regard for the present law , much of which derives from traditions whose origins are obscure . 61 . Further , we feel bound to say this . We have outlined the arguments against a change in the law , and we recognise their weight . We _ believe , however , that they have been met by the counterarguments we have already advanced . There remains one additional counter - argument which we believe to be decisive , namely , the importance which society and the law ought to give to individual freedom of choice and action in matters of private morality . Unless a deliberate attempt is to be made by society , acting through the agency of the law , to equate the sphere of crime with that of sin , there must _ remain _ a_realm_of private morality and immorality which is , in brief and crude terms , not the law ’s business . To say this is not to condone or encourage private immorality . On the contrary , to emphasise the personal and private responsibility of the individual for his own actions , and that is a responsibility which a mature agent can properly be expected to carry for himself without the threat of punishment from the law . 62 . We accordingly recommend that homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence . ” 19
