PART K However , Hart questioned the theory of simply defining crime as a public wrong , for all wrongs affect society in some way or the other : “ Can crimes be distinguished from civil wrongs on the ground that they constitute injuries to society generally which society is interested in preventing ? The difficulty is that society is interested also in the due fulfilment of contracts and the avoidance of traffic accidents and most of the other stuff of civil litigation . ” 98 128 Hart preferred to define crime in terms of the methodology of criminal law and the characteristics of this method . He described criminal law as possessing the following features : “ 4 . The method operates by means of a series of directions , or commands , formulated in general terms , telling people what they must or must not do ... 2 . The commands are taken as valid and binding upon all those who fall within their terms when the time comes for complying with them , whether or not they have been formulated in advance in a single authoritative set of words ... 3 . The commands are subject to one or more sanctions for disobedience which the community is prepared to enforce ... 4 . What distinguishes a criminal from a civil sanction and all that distinguishes it , it is ventured , is the judgment of community condemnation which accompanies and justifies its imposition . ”3 ° ( Numbering and emphasis supplied ) 508 Supra note 294 . 309 Ibid . 149
