PART G 73 The term ‘ sexual health ’ was first defined in a 1975 WHO Technical Report series as “ the integration of the somatic , emotional , intellectual and social aspects of sexual being , in ways that are positively enriching and that enhance personality , communication and love . ”' ® 9 The WHO 's current working definition of sexual health is as follows : “ ’ .. a State of physical , emotional , mental and social well - being in relation to sexuality ; it is not merely the absence of disease , dysfunction or infirmity . Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships , as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences , free of coercion , discrimination and violence . For sexual health to be attained and maintained , the sexual rights of all persons must be respected , protected and fulfilled . ” The WHO further states that “ sexual health can not be defined , understood or made operational without a broad consideration of sexuality , which underlies important behaviours and outcomes related to sexual health . ” It defines sexuality thus : “ a central aspect of being human throughout life encompasses sex , gender identities and roles , sexual orientation , eroticism , pleasure , intimacy and reproduction . Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts , fantasies , desires , beliefs , attitudes , values , behaviours , practices , roles and relationships . While sexuality can include all of these dimensions , not all of them are always experienced or expressed . Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological , psychological , social , economic , political , cultural , legal , historical , religious and spiritual factors . ” 189 World Health Organization , “ Gender and human rights : Defining sexual health ” , ( 2002 ) . 94
