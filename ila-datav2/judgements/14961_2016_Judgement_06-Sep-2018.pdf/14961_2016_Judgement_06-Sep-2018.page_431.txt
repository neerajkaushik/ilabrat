PART L society is determined by popular perceptions existent in society . The continuance of certain symbols , labels , names or body shapes determine the notions , sentiments and mental attitudes of the people towards individuals and things . ° ’ ” ? Constitutional morality determines the mental attitude towards individuals and issues by the text and spirit of the Constitution . It requires that the rights of an individual ought not to be prejudiced by popular notions of society . It assumes that citizens would respect the vision of the framers of the Constitution and would conduct themselves in a way which furthers that vision . Constitutional morality reflects that the ideal of justice is an overriding factor in the struggle for existence over any other notion of social acceptance . It builds and protects the foundations of a democracy , without which any nation will crack under its fissures . For this reason , constitutional morality has to be imbibed by the citizens consistently and continuously . Society must always bear in mind what Dr Ambedkar observed before the Constituent Assembly : “ Constitutional morality is not a natural sentiment . It has to be cultivated . We must realize that our people have yet to learn it . ” 872 Babasaheb . R. Ambedkar , Annihilation of Caste , Navayana Publishing ( 2014 ) ; See also Martha C. Nussbaum , “ Disgust or Equality ?
