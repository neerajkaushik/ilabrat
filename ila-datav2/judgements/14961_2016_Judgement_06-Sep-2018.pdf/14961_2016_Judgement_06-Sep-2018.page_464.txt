any sound or rational principle , since the basis of criminalisation is the “ sexual orientation ” of a person , over which one has “ little or no choice ” . Further , the phrase “ carnal intercourse against the order of nature ” in Section 377 as a determining principle in a penal provision , is too open - ended , giving way to the scope for misuse against members of the LGBT community . Thus , apart from not satisfying the twin - test under Article 14 , Section 377 is also manifestly arbitrary , and hence violative of Article 14 of the Constitution . 15 . SECTION 377 IS VIOLATIVE OF ARTICLE 15 15.1 . Article 15 prohibits the State from discrimination against any citizen on the grounds of religion , race , caste , sex , or place of birth . The object of this provision was to guarantee protection to those citizens who had suffered historical disadvantage , whether it be of a political , social , or economic nature . The term ‘ sex ’ , as it occurs in Article 15 has been given an expansive interpretation by this Court in National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India & Ors . ( supra ) 21
