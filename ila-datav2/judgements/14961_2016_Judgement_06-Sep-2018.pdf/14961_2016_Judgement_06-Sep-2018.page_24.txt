24 Similarly , as per the petitioners , even if there is disapproval by the majority of the sexual orientation or exercise of choice by the LGBT persons , the Court as the final arbiter of the constitutional rights , should disregard social morality and uphold and protect constitutional morality which has been adverted to by this Court in several cases , including Manoj Narula v. Union of India â€™ , for that is the governing rule . It is argued that the Delhi High Court in Naz Foundation ( supra ) has referred to and analysed the concept of constitutional morality and ultimately struck down Section 377 IPC clearly stating that carnal intercourse between homosexuals and heterosexuals with consent can not be an offence . 24 . The LGBT persons can not , according to the petitioners , be penalized simply for choosing a same sex partner , for the constitutional guarantee of choice of partner extends to the LGBT persons as well . Learned counsel for the petitioners and the supporting intervenors have submitted that sexual orientation , being an innate facet of individual identity , is protected under the right to dignity . To bolster the said argument , reliance has been placed upon Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator , Union Territory of Delhi 9 ( 2014 ) 9 SCC 1
