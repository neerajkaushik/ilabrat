PART E therefore , repugnant to heterosexist societal expectations . Kramer argues that : “ Discrimination against gays and _ lesbians reinforces traditional sex roles . The primary thrust of such discrimination is the gender - based stigmatization of gays and lesbians , deriving from the idea that homosexuality departs from traditional gender roles and that “ real ” men and women should not be attracted to a member of the same sex . This portrayal relies heavily on what Bennett Capers calls the “ binary gender system . ”10 ° 46 Bennett Capers defines the binary gender system as based in “ heterosexism , ” which he defines as the “ institutionalized valorization of heterosexual activity . ” Capers , in fact suggests that : “ The sanctioning of discrimination based on sexual orientation perpetuates the subordination not only of lesbians and gays but of women as well . Heterosexism , then , in its reliance on a bipolar system of sex and gender , reinforces sexism in two ways . First , by penalizing persons who do not conform to a bipolar gender system and rewarding men and women who do , the heterosexist hegemony perpetuates a schema that valorizes passive , dependent women , thus contributing to sexism . Second , heterosexism reinforces sexism because it subordinates the female sex through its hierarchical polarity . Because heterosexism perpetuates sexism , the extension of substantial rights to lesbians and gays , who by definition challenge heterosexism and the concept of a binary gender system , would result in a challenge to sexism and to male power . ” 10 10 Ibid . 101 Bennett Capers , “ Note , Sexual Orientation and Title VII ’ , Columbia Law Review ( 1991 ) , at pages 1159 , 1160 , 1163 . 58
