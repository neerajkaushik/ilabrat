PART B validity of Section 377 ‘ to the wisdom of this Court ’ . Implicit in this is that the government has no view of its own on the subject and rests content to abide by the decision of this Court . During the parleys in Court , the ASG however submitted that the court should confine itself to the reference by ruling upon the correctness of Suresh Kumar Koushal v. Naz Foundation ? ( “ Koushal ’ ) . 9 We would have appreciated a categorical statement of position by the government , setting out its views on the validity of Section 377 and on the correctness of Koushal . The ambivalence of the government does not obviate the necessity for a judgment on the issues raised . The challenge to the constitutional validity of Section 377 must squarely be addressed in this proceeding . That is plainly the duty of the Court . Constitutional issues are not decided on concession . The statement of the Union government does not concede to the contention of the petitioners that the statutory provision is invalid . Even if a concession were to be made , that would not conclude the matter for this Court . All that the stand of the government indicates is that it is to the ‘ wisdom ’ of this Court that the matter is left . In reflecting upon this appeal to our wisdom , it is just as well that we as judges remind ourselves of a truth which can unwittingly be forgotten : flattery is a graveyard for the gullible . $ ( 2014 ) 1 SCC 1
