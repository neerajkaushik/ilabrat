The import and effect of Section 377 is that while a consensual heterosexual relationship is permissible , a consensual relationship between LGBT persons is considered to be ‘ carnal ’ , and against the order of nature . Section 377 creates an artificial dichotomy . The natural or innate sexual orientation of a person can not be a ground for discrimination . Where a legislation discriminates on the basis of an intrinsic and core trait of an individual , it can not form a _ reasonable classification based on an intelligible differentia . 14.4 . In National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India & Ors.?1 this Court granted equal protection of laws to transgender persons . There is therefore no justification to deny the same to LGBT persons . 14.5 . A person ’s sexual orientation is intrinsic to their being . It is connected with their individuality , and identity . A classification which discriminates between persons based on their innate nature , would be violative of their fundamental rights , and can not withstand the test of constitutional morality . 21 ( 2014 ) 5 SCC 438 18
