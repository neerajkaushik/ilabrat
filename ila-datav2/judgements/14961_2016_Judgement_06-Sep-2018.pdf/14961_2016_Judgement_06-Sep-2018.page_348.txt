PART G outlaw any law which lends the authority of the state to obstructing its fulfilment . G Section 377 and the right to health “ Should medicine ever fulfil its great ends , it must enter into the larger political and social life of our time ; it must indicate the barriers which obstruct the normal completion of the life cycle and remove them . ” - Virchow Rudolf 68 In the evolution of its jurisprudence on the constitutional right to life under Article 21 , this Court has consistently held that the right to life is meaningless unless accompanied by the guarantee of certain concomitant rights including , but not limited to , the right to health . ' ” * The right to health is understood to be indispensable to a life of dignity and well - being , and includes , for instance , the right to emergency medical care and the right to the maintenance and improvement of public health . ’ It would be useful to refer to judgments of this Court which have recognised the right to health . 172 Dipika Jain and Kimberly Rhoten , “ The Heteronormative State and the Right to Health in India ’ , NUJS Law Review , Vol . 6 ( 2013 ) . 173 C.E.S.C.
