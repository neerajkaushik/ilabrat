have also added that the Section needs to be retained given the fact that it is only a parliamentary reflection of the prevailing social mores of today in large segments of society . According to them , this furthers a compelling state interest to reinforce morals in public life which is not disproportionate in nature . We are afraid that , given the march of events in constitutional law by this Court , and parliamentary recognition of the plight of such persons in certain provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act , 2017 , it will not be open for a constitutional court to substitute societal morality with constitutional morality , as has been stated by us hereinabove . Further , as stated in S. Khushboo v. Kanniammal and Anr . , ( 2010 ) 5 SCC 600 , at paragraphs 46 and 50 , this Court made it clear that notions of social morality are inherently subjective and the criminal law can not be used as a means to unduly interfere with the domain of personal autonomy . Morality and criminality are not co - extensive - sin is not punishable on earth by Courts set up by the State but elsewhere ; crime alone is punishable on earth . To confuse the one with the other is what causes the death knell of Section 377 , insofar as it applies to consenting homosexual adults . 75
