“ Il . Texas Penal Code S. 21.06 reinforces prejudice , discrimination , and violence against gay men and lesbians ... Although many gay men and lesbians learn to cope with the social stigma against homosexuality , this_pattern_of prejudice can_cause_gay people serious psychological distress , especially if they attempt to conceal_or deny their sexual orientation .... ”49 ( emphasis supplied )      It is pertinent to mention that in India the Mental Healthcare Act , 2017 came into force on July 7 , 2018 . Sections 18(1 ) and ( 2 ) read with 21(1)(a ) of the Mental Healthcare Act , 2017 provide for the right to access mental healthcare and equal treatment of people with physical and mental illnesses without discrimination , inter alia , on the basis of “ sexual orientation ” . This gives rise to a paradoxical situation since Section 377 criminalises LGBT persons , which inhibits them from accessing health - care facilities , while the Mental Healthcare Act , 2017 provides a right to access mental healthcare without discrimination , even on the ground of ‘ sexual orientation ’ . 49 Supra note 16 , at page 3 39
