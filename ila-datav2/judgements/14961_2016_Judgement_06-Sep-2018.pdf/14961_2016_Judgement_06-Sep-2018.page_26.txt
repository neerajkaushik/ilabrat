26 valid at the time of its adoption may cease to be so on account of changing social norms . 27 . Section 377 , as argued by the petitioners , is manifestly arbitrary and over - broad and for the said purpose , immense inspiration has been drawn from the principles stated in Shayara Bano v. Union of India and others ' * , for making consensual relationship a crime on the ground that it is against the order of nature suffers from manifest arbitrariness at the fulcrum . 28 . It is the case of the petitioners that Section 377 violates Article 15 of the Constitution since there is discrimination inherent in it based on the sex of a person ’s sexual partner as under Section 376(c ) to ( e ) , a person can be prosecuted for acts done with an opposite sex partner without her consent , whereas the same acts if done with a same - sex partner are criminalized even if the partner consents . The petitioners have drawn the attention of this Court to the Justice J.S Verma Committee on Amendments to Criminal Law which had observed that ‘ sex ’ occurring in Article 15 includes sexual orientation and , thus , as per the petitioners , Section 377 is also violative of Article 15 of the Constitution on this count . 13(2017 ) 9 SCC 1
