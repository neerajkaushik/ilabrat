There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no longer willing to be plunged into an abyss of injustice where they experience the bleakness of corroding despair . | hope , sirs , you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience . ” ( Letter from a Birmingham Jail ) * ° 24 Indian citizens belonging to sexual minorities have waited . They have waited and watched as their fellow citizens were freed from the British yoke while their fundamental freedoms remained restrained under an antiquated and anachronistic colonial - era law — forcing them to live in hiding , in fear , and as second - class citizens . In seeking an adjudication of the validity of Section 377 , these citizens urge that the acts which the provision makes culpable should be decriminalised . But this case involves much more than merely decriminalising certain conduct which has been proscribed by a colonial law . The case is about an aspiration to realise constitutional rights . It is about a right which every human being has , to live with dignity . It is about enabling these citizens to realise the worth of equal citizenship .
