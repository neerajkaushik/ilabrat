PART K that is purely personal , and that when society does interfere , “ the odds are that it interferes wrongly and in the wrong place . ”9 ° 135 Christopher R Leslie points out the dangers of letting morality creep into law : “ Current generations enshrine their morality by passing laws and perpetuate their prejudices by handing these laws down to their children . Soon , statutes take on lives of their own , and their very existence justifies their premises and consequent implications . The underlying premises of ancient laws are rarely discussed , let alone scrutinized . ”3 ° 4 Leslie further adds that “ sodomy laws do not merely express societal disapproval ; they go much further by creating a criminal class ” ° ® : “ Sodomy laws are kept on the books , even though state governments do not intend to actively enforce them , because the laws send a message to society that homosexuality is unacceptable . Even without actual criminal prosecution , the laws carry meaning ... In short , the primary importance of sodomy laws today is the government ’s message to diminish the societal status of gay men and lesbians . ”36 ° 136 A broad analysis of criminal theory points to the general conclusion that criminologists and legal philosophers have long been in agreement about one basic characteristic of crime : that it should injure a third person or the society . 363 Ibid . 364 Christopher .
