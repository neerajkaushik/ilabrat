PART K sodomy . ° ' * According to Bentham , homosexuality , if viewed outside the realms of morality and religion , is neutral behaviour which gives the participants pleasure and does not cause pain to anyone else . ° ' > Therefore , he concluded that such an act can not constitute an offence , and there is “ no reason for punishing it at all . ”$ " ® 130 Bentham tested sodomy laws on three main principles : ( i ) whether they produce any primary mischief , i.e. , direct harm to another person ; ( ii ) whether they produce any secondary mischief , i.e. , harm to the stability and security of society ; and ( iii ) whether they cause any danger to society . ‘ He argued that sodomy laws do not satisfy any of the above tests , and hence , should be repealed . On the first principle of primary mischief , Bentham said : “ As to any primary mischief , it is evident that it produces no pain in anyone . On the contrary it produces pleasure , and that a pleasure which , by their perverted taste , is by this supposition preferred to that pleasure which is in general reputed the greatest . The partners are both willing . If either of them be unwilling , the act is not that which we have here in view : it is an offence totally different in its nature of effects : it is a personal injury ; it is a kind of rape . ” 318 314 Ibid . 315 Ibid . 316 Ibid .
