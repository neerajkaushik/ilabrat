PART E 33 . The Petitioners contend that ( i ) Section 377 discriminates on the basis of sex and violates Articles 15 and 16 ; and ( ii ) Discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation is in fact , discrimination on the ground of sex . The intervenors argue that ( i ) Section 377 criminalizes acts and not people ; ( ii ) It is not discriminatory because the prohibition on anal and oral sex applies equally to both heterosexual and homosexual couples ; and ( iii ) Article 15 prohibits discrimination on the ground of ‘ sex ’ which can not be interpreted so broadly as to include ‘ sexual orientation ’ . 34 When the constitutionality of a law is challenged on the ground that it violates the guarantees in Part Ill of the Constitution , what is determinative is its effect on the infringement of fundamental rights.64 This affords the guaranteed freedoms their true potential against a claim by the state that the infringement of the right was not the object of the provision . It is not the object of the law which impairs the rights of the citizens . Nor is the form of the action taken determinative of the protection that can be claimed . It is the effect of the law upon the fundamental right which calls the courts to step in and remedy the violation . The individual is aggrieved because the law hurts . The hurt to the individual is measured by the violation of a protected right .
