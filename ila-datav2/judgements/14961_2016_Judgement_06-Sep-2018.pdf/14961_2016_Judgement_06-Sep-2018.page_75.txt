"â€œ2 113 . Our Constitution was visualized with the aim of securing to the citizens of our country inalienable rights which were essential for fostering a spirit of growth and development and at the same time ensuring that the three organs of the State working under the aegis of the Constitution and deriving their authority from the supreme document , that is , the Constitution , practise constitutional morality . The Executive , the Legislature and the Judiciary all have to stay alive to the concept of constitutional morality . 49 Constituent Assembly Debates , Vol . 7 ( 4th November 1948 )
