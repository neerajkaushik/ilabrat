44 recast or re - frame the legislation for the good reason that it has no power to legislate since the power to legislate has not been conferred upon the Court and , therefore , the Courts can not add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there . The Courts are to decide what the law is and not what it should be . 64 . Itis also the case of the applicant that the decriminalization of Section 377 IPC will open a floodgate of social issues which the legislative domain is not capable of accommodating as same sex marriages would become social experiments with unpredictable outcome . 65 . Further , it is the contention of the applicant that decriminalization of Section 377 IPC will have cascading effect on existing laws such as Section 32(d ) of the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act , 1936 ; Section 27(7)(1A ) A of the Special Marriage Act , 1954 which permits a wife to present a petition for divorce to the district court on the ground,â€”(i ) that her husband has , since the solemnization of the marriage , been guilty of rape , sodomy or bestiality ; Section 10(2 ) of the Indian Divorce Act , 1869 and Section 13(2 ) of the Hindu Marriage Act , 1955 .
