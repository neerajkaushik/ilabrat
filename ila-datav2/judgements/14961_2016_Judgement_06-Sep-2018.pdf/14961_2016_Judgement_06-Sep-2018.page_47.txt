47 While so opining , the Court held that Section 377 IPC would apply irrespective of age and consent , for Section 377 IPC does not criminalize a particular people or identity or orientation and only identifies certain acts which , when committed , would constitute an offence . Such a prohibition , in the Court 's view in Suresh Koushal ( supra ) , regulates sexual conduct regardless of gender identity and orientation . 71 . The Court further observed that those who indulge in carnal intercourse in the ordinary course and those who indulge in carnal intercourse against the order of nature constitute different classes and the people falling in the latter category can not claim that Section 377 IPC suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and _ irrational classification . The Court further observed that while reading down Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code , it can not be overlooked that only a minuscule fraction of the country 's population constitutes lesbians , gays , bisexuals or transgenders and in last more than 150 years , less than 200 persons have been prosecuted under Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code which can not , therefore , be made a sound basis for declaring Section 377 IPC ultra vires the provisions of Articles 14 , 15 and 21 of the Constitution .
