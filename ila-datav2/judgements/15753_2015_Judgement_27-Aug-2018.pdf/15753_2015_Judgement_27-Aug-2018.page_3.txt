4 . Learned counsel for the appellants submits that the notice to vacate the shops in the hospital premises is arbitrary . No show cause notice with an opportunity to convince the authorities not to order removal was provided . Closure of the shop will infringe the fundamental rights of the appellants under Article 19(1)(g ) of the Constitution . The supply of generic medicines by the State Government will not be disturbed by the medicine shops being operated by the appellants . The presence of the shops would only aid availability of medicines to the patients . 5 . Learned counsel for the State submitted that the medicine shops were permitted at a time when patients had to procure medicines on their own . With the advent of the new scheme for supplies of medicines by the Government , there exists no need for medicine shops within the hospital premises . In fact , the shop premises can be better utilized to facilitate supply of free medicines by the Government itself to the patients . The lease has long expired and no steps have been taken for renewal by the appellants .
