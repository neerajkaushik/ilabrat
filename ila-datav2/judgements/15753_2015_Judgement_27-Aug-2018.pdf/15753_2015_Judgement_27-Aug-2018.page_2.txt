together and are being disposed by a common order . Suffice to observe , that in the limited nature of the controversy , we propose to take notice of the facts only to the extent necessary for purposes of the present order . 3 . Both the appellants are lessees of the State Government for the shop premises situated within the compound of the District Hospital , Ujjain , Civil Hospital , Nagda , Khachrod , Mahidpur , Badnagar etc . They have been asked in 2013 to vacate the shop premises and shift from the Civil Hospital compound . The justification is the formulation of a Government Scheme i.e. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Nishulka Aushadhi Vitaran Yojna for supply of free essential drugs to all classes of patients by the Government . It is not in dispute that the shop premises was constructed by the authorities and does not fall in the category of an unauthorized construction . It was settled with the appellants by open bid in 2000/2001 . The lease period has long since expired and the lease has not been renewed .
