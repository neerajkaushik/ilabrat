Since payment of rent or monetary consideration may have been made secretly , the law does not require such payment to be proved by affirmative evidence and the court is permitted to draw its own inference upon the facts of the case proved at the trial , including the delivery of exclusive possession to infer that the premises were sub - let . ” 48 . In our considered opinion , the aforesaid principle of law fully applies to the case at hand against the respondent due to his contradicting stand and by admitting Joynal Mullick ’s presence in the suit shop but not being able to properly prove the nature and the capacity in which he was sitting in the suit shop . 49 .
