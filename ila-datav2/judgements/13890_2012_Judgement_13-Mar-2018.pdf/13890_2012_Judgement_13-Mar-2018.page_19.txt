In any event , the question as to whether the persons practicing the profession of law exclusively in nonlitigious matters are covered under the 1961 Act , or not was not an issue directly or indirectly considered by the Apex Court in the case of O.N. Mohindroo ( supra ) . Therefore , the decision of the Apex Court in the above case does not support the case of the contesting respondents . 55 . It was contended by the counsel for Union of India that if it is held that the 1961 Act applies to persons practising in non - litigious matters , then no bureaucrat would be able to draft or give any opinion in non - litigious matters without being enrolled as an advocate . There is no merit in the above argument , because , there is a distinction between a bureaucrat drafting or giving opinion , during the course of his employment and a law firm or an advocate drafting or giving opinion to the clients on professional basis . Moreover , a bureaucrat drafting documents or giving opinion is answerable to _ his ’ superiors , whereas , a law firm or an individual engaged in non litigious ’ matters , that is , drafting documents / giving opinion or rendering any other legal assistance are answerable to none . To avoid such anomaly , the 1961 Act has been enacted so as to cover all persons practising the profession of law be it in litigious matters or in non - litigious matters within the purview of the 1961 Act . 56 . The argument that the 1961 Act and the Bar Councils constituted there under have limited role to play has been time and again negatived by the Apex Court . Recently , the Apex Court in the case of Bar Council of India v. Board of Management , Dayanand College of Law reported in MANU / SC/5219/2006 : ( 2007 ) 2 SCC 202 held thus : It may not be correct to say that the Bar Council of India is totally unconcerned with the legal education , though primarily legal education may also be within the province 19
