any liaison office in India offers advice to their clients on foreign law , there was no legal bar to do so . 16 . The Bombay High Court in its judgment observed : â€œ 44 , It appears that before approaching RBI , these foreign law firms had approached the Foreign Investment Promotion Board ( FIPB for short ) a High Powered body established under the New Industrial Policy seeking their approval in the matter . The FIPB had rejected the proposal submitted by the foreign law firms . Thereafter , these law firms sought approval from RBI and RBI granted the approval in spite of the rejection of FIPB . Though specific grievance to that effect is made in the petition , the RBI has chosen not to deal with those grievances in its affidavit in reply . Thus , in the present case , apparently , the stand taken by RBI & FIPB are mutually contradictory . 45 . In any event , the fundamental question to be considered herein is , whether the foreign law firms namely respondent Nos . 12 to 14 by opening liaison offices in India could carry on the practise in non litigious matters without being enrolled as Advocates under the 1961 Act ? 46 . Before dealing with the rival contentions on the above question , we may quote Sections 29 , 30 , 33 and 35 of the 1961 Act , which read thus : 29 . Advocates to be the only recognised class of persons entitled to practice law . Subject to the provisions of this Act and any rules made there under , there shall , as from the appointed day , be only one class of persons entitled to practise the profession of law , namely , advocates . ( not brought into force so far ) 30 . Right of advocates to practise . -Subject to provisions of this Act , every advocate whose name is entered in the State roll shall be entitled as of right to practise throughout the territories to which this Act extends , 13
