under Section 29 of the 1961 Act . A person enrolled as an advocate under Section 29 of the 1961 Act , may or may not be desirous of appearing before the Courts . He may be interested in practising only in non litigious matters . Therefore , the bar under Section 33 from appearing in any Court ( except when permitted by Court under Section 32 of the 1961 Act or any other Act ) unless enrolled as an advocate does not bar a person from being enrolled as an advocate under Section 29 of the 1961 Act for practising the profession of law in non litigious matters . The Apex Court in the case of Ex - Capt . Harish Uppal ( supra ) has held that the right to practise is the genus of which the right to appear and conduct cases in the Court may be a specie . Therefore , the fact that Section 33 of the 1961 Act provides that advocates alone are entitled to practice before any Court / authority it can not be inferred that the 1961 Act applies only to persons practising in litigious matters and would not apply to person practising in non litigious matters . 51 , It was contended that the 1961 Act does not contain any penal provisions for breaches committed by a person practicing in nonlitigious matter and , therefore , the 1961 Act can not apply to persons practising in nonlitigious matters . There is no merit in this contention , because , Section 35 of the 1961 Act provides punishment to an advocate who is found to be guilty of professional or other misconduct . The fact that Section 45 of the 1961 Act provides imprisonment for persons illegally practicing in Courts and before other authorities , it can not be said that the 1961 Act does not contain provisions to deal with the persons found guilty of misconduct while practising in non litigious matters . Once it is held that the persons entitled to practice the profession of law under the 1961 Act covers the persons practising the profession of law in litigious matters as _ well as _ non - litigious matters , then , the penal provisions contained in Section 35 of the 1961 Act would apply not only to persons practising in litigious matter , but would also apply to persons practising the profession of law in non - litigious matters .
