the provisions of the Arbitration Act , foreign lawyers may not be debarred from conducting arbitration proceedings arising out of international commercial arbitration in view of Sections 32 and 33 of the Advocates Act . However , they will be governed by code of conduct applicable to the legal profession in India . Bar Council of India or the Union of India are at liberty to frame rules in this regard . 46 . We also modify the direction of the Madras High Court in Para 63(iv ) that the B.P.O. Companies providing wide range of customized and integrated services and functions to its customers like word processing , secretarial support , transcription services , proof reading services , travel desk support services , etc . do not come within the purview of the Advocates Act , 1961 or the Bar Council of India Rules . We hold that mere label of such services can not be treated as conclusive . If in pith and substance the services amount to practice of law , the provisions of the Advocates Act will apply and foreign law firms or foreign lawyers will not be allowed to do so . The Civil Appeals are disposed of accordingly . NEW DELHI ; MARCH 13 , 2018 . 52
