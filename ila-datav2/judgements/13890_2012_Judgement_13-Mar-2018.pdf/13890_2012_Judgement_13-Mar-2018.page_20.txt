of the universities . But , as the apex professional body , the Bar Council of India is concerned with the standards of the legal profession and the equipment of those who seek entry into that profession . The Bar Council of India is also thus concerned with the legal education in the country . Therefore , instead of taking a pendantic view of the situation , the State Government and the recommending authority are expected to ensure that the requirement set down by the Bar Council of India is also complied with . Thus , when efforts are being made to see that the legal profession stand tall in this fast changing world , it would be improper to hold that the 1961 Act and the Bar Council constituted there under have limited role to play in the field relating to practising the profession of law . 57 . It is not in dispute that once a person is enrolled as an advocate , he is entitled to practise the profession of law in litigious matters as well as non - litigious matters . If the argument of the respondents that the 1961 Act is restricted to the persons practising the profession of law in litigious matters is accepted , then an advocate found guilty of misconduct in performing his duties while practising in non - litigious matters can not be punished under the 1961 Act . Similarly , where an advocate who is debarred for professional misconduct can merrily carry on the practise in nonlitigious matters on the ground that the 1961 Act is not applicable to the persons practising the profession of law in non litigious matters . Such an argument which defeats the object of the 1961 Act can not be accepted . 58 . It may be noted that Rule 6(1 ) in Chapter IH Part VI of the Bar Council of India Rules framed under Section 49(1 ) ( ah ) of the 1961 Act provides that an advocate whose name has been removed by an order of the Supreme Court or a High Court or the Bar Council as the case may be , shall not be entitled to practise the profession of law either before the Court 20
