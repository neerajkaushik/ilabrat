very object of the 1961 Act and the Rules framed by the Bar Council of India are to ensure that the _ persons practising the profession of law whether in litigious matters or in non litigious matters , maintain high standards in professional conduct â€™ and etiquette and , therefore , it can not be said that the persons practising in non litigious matters are not governed by the 1961 Act . 52 . Strong reliance was placed by the counsel for the respondent No . 12 on the decision of the Apex Court in the case of O.N. Mohindroo ( supra ) in support of his contention that the 1961 Act applies only to persons practising the profession of law before Courts / Tribunals / other authorities . It is true that the Apex Court in the above case has held that the 1961 Act is enacted by the Parliament in exercise of its powers under entry 77 and 78 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to _ the _ Constitution . However , the fact that entry 77 and 78 in List I refers to the persons practising before the Supreme Court and the High Courts , it can not be said that the 1961 Act is restricted to the persons practising only before the Supreme Court and High Courts . Practising the profession of law involves a larger concept whereas , practising before the Courts is only a part of that concept . If the literal construction put forth by the respondents is accepted then , the Parliament under entry 77 & 78 in List I of the Seventh Schedule to make legislation only in respect of the advocates practicing before the Supreme Court / High Courts and the Parliament can not legislate under that entry in respect of advocates practising before the District Courts/ Magistrate 's Courts / other Courts / Tribunals / authorities and consequently , the 1961 Act to the extent it applies to advocates practising in Courts other than the High Courts and Supreme Court would be ultra vires the Constitution . Such a narrow construction is unwarranted because , once the Parliament invokes its power to legislate on advocates practising the profession of law , then the entire field relating to advocates would be open to the Parliament to legislate and accordingly the 1961 Act has been enacted 18
