21 We are also informed that 810 candidates also had a grievance with regard to whitener being used . However , for those 810 candidates , additional vacancies were created , therefore , they do not come in the way of the present issue . Since there is no dispute with regard to 810 candidates , who are covered by the Judgment passed by this Court in Civil Appeal Nos . 587 - 588 of 2016 dated 19.01.2016 , we direct the learned Additional Advocate General to ascertain as to what is the impediment in sending them for training since their issue is finally settled by the Judgment of this Court . We are informed that pursuant to the directions issued by the High Court regarding reservation , a list of 3784 candidates has been published on 26.11.2016 , out of which 3533 have already undergone training . We direct the learned Additional Advocate General to clarify as to what is the impediment in sending the remaining candidates also for training . He will also take instruction as to whether 237 people , who went to the High Court , can also be sent for training in respect of the vacancies which would have arisen subsequent to the advertisement , subject of course to their eligibility . ‚Äù 13 . In SLP ( C ) No.12538 of 2016 , an affidavit in reply was filed on behalf of the State Government stating that each of the petitioners had secured marks less than the cut off marks . As regards 226 posts which could not be filled up due to non - availability of suitable candidates , attention was invited to the provisions of Section 3(2 ) of 1993 Act whereunder unfilled vacancies would be required to be carried forward for further two years and the vacancies could be treated to be lapsed only if no sufficient candidates were available in such subsequent selection(s ) .
