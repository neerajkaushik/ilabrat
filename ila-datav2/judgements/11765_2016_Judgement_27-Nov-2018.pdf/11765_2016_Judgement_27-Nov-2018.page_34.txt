34 27 . We now proceed to deal with the matters concerning vacancies and the directions that are required to be passed , in the facts and circumstances of the present matters . 28 . According to the chart referred to above , though the number of candidates called for group discussion ought to have been thrice the notified vacancies i.e. 12030 , the Board had called 14256 candidates . The first list viz . the result notified on 25.06.2015 had named 3784 candidates leaving out 226 unfilled posts as a result of non - availability of candidates in the category of dependents of freedom fighters as stated above . In terms of the decisions of this Court in Hanuman Dutt Shukla ( supra ) 809 candidates were given benefit , followed by 24 similarly situated candidates . To this number of 833 we will have to add 189 similarly situated candidates as dealt with in the order passed by this Court on 14.08.2018 . The decision of this Court in Hanuman Dutt Shukla ( supra ) was very clear that the revised final list dated 25.06.2015 ought not to be disturbed but benefit must be given to those candidates who were excluded for use of whitener / blade etc . while answering the main examination . This aspect was repeatedly made clear that those vacancies would be in addition and therefore we have no hesitation in stating that the number of 1022 ( 809 in terms of Hanuman Dutt Shukla ( supra ) , 24 in terms of case of Deepak Kumar and 189 in terms of the order dated 14.08.2018 ) have to be reckoned in addition to the figure of 4010 .
