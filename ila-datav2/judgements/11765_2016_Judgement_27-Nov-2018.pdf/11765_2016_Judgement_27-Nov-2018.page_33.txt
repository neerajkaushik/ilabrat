33 available in the present selection itself . One more reason for such direction is that large number of posts namely more than 8000 posts are currently available for succeeding selections . Similarly , the decision of the High Court in Special Appeal No.416 of 2016 , in our view , was correct . Going by the Rules , only 12030 candidates could have been allowed to participate in Group Discussion against the number of 14256 . But at this length of time , it would be inappropriate to re - do the exercise and eliminate the excess number from consideration , more particularly when the number of 14256 represents all those who secured 50 % or more marks in the written examination and there are still 607 vacancies to be filled up . 26 . In the order dated 31.10.2017 , this Court had emphasized the adherence to eligibility of 50 % while the order dated 30.11.2017 had directed completion of Selection process in the order of merit . Thereafter , the order dated 16.01.2018 categorically stated that three factors namely , merit , reservation and preference should be taken into consideration . We , therefore , can not accept the submission that the benefit , if any , of the order or directions should be confined to those who are / were before this Court or the High Court alone , in the capacity of either the petitioners or the intervenors ignoring merit .
