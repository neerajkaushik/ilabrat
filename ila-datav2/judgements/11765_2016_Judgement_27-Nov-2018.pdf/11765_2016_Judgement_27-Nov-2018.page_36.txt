36 the present selection itself , strictly in order of merit and subject to fulfilment of having obtained 50 % or more marks . B ) There are 226 unfilled posts as a result of non - availability of candidates in the cadre of dependents of freedom fighters . Normally , “ freedom fighters ” is not a category which , over a period of time , would keep increasing . In any case , there are selections which are round the corner in which more than 8000 posts are available for the candidates . The interest of those candidates who answer the description “ dependents of freedom fighters ” would therefore be taken care of in the succeeding selections . We , therefore , direct that these 226 posts should also be made available for the present selection . C ) The State Government and its authorities are therefore directed to make available 833 posts ( 607 + 226 ) for the present selection strictly in order of merit subject to the fulfillment of the criteria that the candidates had obtained 50 % or more in the main written examination , in keeping with principles of reservation and preference . D ) We make it clear that direction to fill - up the above 833 posts in terms of this Judgment is in addition to any other directions already issued .
