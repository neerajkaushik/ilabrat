4 . As far as development charges are _ concerned , learned counsel for the respondent points out that the exemplar was only for 99 sq . yds . , whereas the total acquired land is 05 acres . In the circumstances , the High Court rightly deducted 60 % towards development costs / charges , it is submitted . 5 . We are~ afraid , this argument can not be appreciated . There is no challenge by the respondent on the value fixed . The High Court has taken the exemplar for the purpose of land value and the only dispute is with regard to the deduction towards development charges . It is not disputed that the acquired land is abutting residential area of Mallapur , which is a Mandal Headquarter where bank , high school , bus stand , telephone exchange , police station , primary health centre , cinema hall , petrol pumps are located . It may be noted that there is no discussion at all in the impugned judgment for such deduction . It may also be seen that even according to the Land Acquisition Collector while passing the award , the deduction was only 30 % towards development costs . 6 . In the above circumstances , the appeals are disposed of as follows :   The deduction towards development costs / charges shall only be 30 % of the land value fixed by the High Court and in all other respects the impugned judgment stands confirmed . The appellants will also be entitled to statutory benefits arising out of this re - fixation .
