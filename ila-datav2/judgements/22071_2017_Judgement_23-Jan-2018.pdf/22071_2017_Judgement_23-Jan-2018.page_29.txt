this Court again referred to the blurring of lines between errors of law and errors of jurisdiction found in Anisminic ( supra ) as follows : “ Though the dividing line between lack of jurisdiction or power and erroneous exercise of it has become thin with the decision of the House of Lords in the Anisminic case , [ ( 1967 ) 3 WLR 382 ] we do not think that the distinction between the two has been completely wiped out . We are aware of the difficulty in formulating an exhaustive rule to tell when there is lack of power and when there is an erroneous exercise of it . The difficulty has arisen because the word “ jurisdiction ” is an expression which is used in a variety of senses and takes its colour from its context , ( see per Diplock , J. , at p. 394 in the Anisminic case ) . Whereas the “ pure ” theory of jurisdiction would reduce jurisdictional control to a vanishing point , the adoption of a narrower meaning might result in a more useful legal concept even though the formal structure of law may lose something of its logical symmetry . “ At bottom the problem of defining the concept of jurisdiction for purpose of judicial review has been one of public policy rather than one of logic ’ . [ S. A. Smith : “ Judicial Review of Administrative Action ” , 2nd Edn . , p. 98 ] And viewed from the aspect of public policy as reflected in the provisions of the 1950 and 1951 Acts , we do not think that a wrong decision on a question of ordinary residence for the purpose of entering a person 's name in the electoral roll should be treated as a jurisdictional error which can be judicially reviewed either in a civil court or before an election tribunal . ”
