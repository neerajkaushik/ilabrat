expression “ jurisdiction ” occurring in Section 9A and held an earlier judgment of this Court to be per incuriam . Though the Constitution Bench judgment in Ittavira ( supra ) was mentioned by the Bench , referring to the argument of one of the counsel for the parties , in the concluding portion , this judgment is not referred to at all . In any case , the reasoning of the Court in that case was in the context of Section 9A which , when contrasted with Order XIV of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 , made the Court accept the wider concept of “ jurisdiction ” as laid down in Pandurang ( supra ) . 29 . In our view , therefore , it is clear that the award dated 23 % July , 2015 is an interim award , which being an arbitral award , can be challenged separately and independently under Section 34 of the Act . We are of the view that such an award , which does not relate to the arbitral tribunal 's own jurisdiction under Section 16 , does not have to follow the drill of Section 16(5 ) and ( 6 ) of the Act . Having said this , we are of the view that Parliament may consider amending Section 34 of the Act so as to consolidate all interim awards together with the final arbitral award , so that one challenge under Section 34 can be made 31
