pass an award and dismisses the arbitral proceedings , the party aggrieved is not without a remedy . Section 37(2 ) deals with such a situation . Where the plea of absence of jurisdiction or a claim being in excess of jurisdiction is accepted by the Arbitral Tribunal and it refuses to go into the merits of the claim by declining jurisdiction , a direct appeal is provided . In the context of Section 16 and the specific wording of Section 37(2)(a ) of the Act , it would be appropriate to hold that what is made directly appealable by Section 37(2)(a ) of the Act is only an acceptance of a plea of absence of jurisdiction , or of excessive exercise of jurisdiction and the refusal to proceed further either wholly or partly . 19 . In a case where a counterclaim is referred to and dealt with and a plea that the counterclaim does not survive in view of the settlement of disputes between the parties earlier arrived at is accepted , it could not be held to be a case of refusal to exercise jurisdiction by the Arbitral Tribunal . Same is the position when an Arbitral Tribunal finds that a claim was dead and was not available to be made at the relevant time or that the claim was not maintainable for other valid reasons or that the claim was barred by limitation . They are all adjudications by the Tribunal on the merits of the claim and in such a case the aggrieved party can have recourse only to Section 34 of the Act and will have to succeed on establishing any of the grounds available under that provision . It would not be open to that party to take up the position that by refusing to go into the merits of his claim , the Arbitral Tribunal had upheld a plea that it does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim and hence the award or order made by it , comes within the purview of Section 16(2 ) of the Act and consequently is appealable under Section 37(2 ) ( a ) of the Act . ‚Äù 26
