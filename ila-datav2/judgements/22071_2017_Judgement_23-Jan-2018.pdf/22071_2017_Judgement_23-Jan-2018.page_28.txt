reduce the difference between jurisdictional error and error of law within jurisdiction almost to vanishing point . The practical effect of the decision is that any error of law can be reckoned as jurisdictional . This comes perilously close to saying that there is jurisdiction if the decision is right in law but none if it is wrong . Almost any misconstruction of a statute can be represented as “ basing their decision on a matter with which they have no right to deal ” , “ imposing an unwarranted condition ” or “ addressing themselves to a wrong question ” . The majority opinion in the case leaves a Court or Tribunal with virtually no margin of legal error .
