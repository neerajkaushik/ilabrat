arbitral award . However , it is important to add a note of caution . In an appropriate case , the issue of more than one award may be necessitated on the facts of that case . However , by dealing with the matter in a piecemeal fashion , what must be borne in mind is that the resolution of the dispute as a whole will be delayed and parties will be put to additional expense . The arbitral tribunal should , therefore , consider whether there is any real advantage in delivering interim awards or in proceeding with the matter as a whole and delivering one final award , bearing in mind the avoidance of delay and additional expense . Ultimately , a fair means for resolution of all disputes should be uppermost in the mind of the arbitral tribunal . 10 . To complete the scheme of the Act , Section 32(1 ) is also material . This section goes on to state that the arbitral proceedings would be terminated only by the final arbitral award , as opposed to an interim award , thus making it clear that there can be one or more interim awards , prior to a final award , which conclusively determine some of the issues between the parties , culminating in a final arbitral award which ultimately decides all remaining issues between the parties .
