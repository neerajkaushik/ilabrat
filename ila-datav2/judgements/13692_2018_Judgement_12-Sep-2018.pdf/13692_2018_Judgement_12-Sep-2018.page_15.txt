effect from a date in 2008 , but had not been utilized till the Division Bench judgment was passed against the Appellant . We are also told that the remaining stock of material has been disposed of under the trade name “ CHYMTRAL ” , and that material manufactured after the Division Bench judgment is not being sold under the said trade name despite the stay granted in favour of the Appellant . Seeing the sales figures of ‘ Chymowok ’ from December , 2017 till August , 2018 and the fact that the Appellant ’s sales under the “ new ” trade name are substantial , we do not think that we should exercise our discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India in favour of the Appellant , seeing that the balance of convenience is well served by the judgment under appeal . The Appeal is , therefore , rejected . Usanansnenanenensans aennstenensats J. ( R.F. Nariman ) Uisanansnenanenennans aennstenensans J. ( Indu Malhotra ) New Delhi ; September 12 , 2018 . 15
