9 ) We may indicate , at this juncture , that insofar as the second test is concerned , this Court has in a plethora of judgments held that though passing off is , in essence , an action based on deceit , fraud is not a necessary element of a right of action , and that the defendant 's state of mind is wholly irrelevant to the existence of a cause of action for passing off , if otherwise the defendant has imitated or adopted the Plaintiff 's mark . We need only state the law from one of our judgments , namely , in Laxmikant V. Patel vs. Chetanbhai Shah and Another , ( 2002 ) 3 SCC 65 , which reads as under : â€œ 13 In an action for passing - off it is usual , rather essential , to seek an injunction , temporary or adinterim . The principles for the grant of such injunction are the same as in the case of any other action against injury complained of . The plaintiff must prove a prima facie case , availability of balance of convenience in his favour and his suffering an irreparable injury in the absence of grant of injunction . According to Kerly ( ibid , para 16.16 ) passing - off cases are often cases of deliberate and intentional misrepresentation , but it is well - settled that fraud is not a necessary element of the right of action , and the absence of an intention to deceive is not a defence , though proof of fraudulent intention may materially assist a plaintiff in establishing probability of deception . Christopher Wadlow in Law of Passing - Off ( 1995 Edition , at p.3.06 ) states that the plaintiff does not have to prove actual damage in order to succeed in an action for passing - off .
