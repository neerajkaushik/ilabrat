Likelihood of damage is sufficient . The same learned author states that the defendant ’s state of mind is wholly irrelevant to the existence of the cause of action for passing - off ( ibid , paras 4.20 and 7.15 ) . As to how the injunction granted by the Court would shape depends on the facts and circumstances of each case . Where a defendant has imitated or adopted the plaintiff 's distinctive trade mark or business name , the order may be an absolute injunction that he would not use or carry on business under that name . ( Kerly , ibid , para 16.97 ) . ” This judgment has been followed in S. Syed Mohideen vs. P. Sulochana Bai , ( 2016 ) 2 SCC 683 at 699 - 700 . Also , in Satyam Infoway Ltd. vs. Siffynet Solutions Pvt . Ltd. , ( 2004 ) 6 SCC 145 , this Court held : “ 14 The second element that must be established by a plaintiff in a passing - off action is misrepresentation by the defendant to the public . The word misrepresentation does not mean that the plaintiff has to prove any mala fide intention on the part of the defendant . Of course , if the misrepresentation is intentional , it might lead to an inference that the reputation of the plaintiff is such that it is worth the defendant 's while to cash in on it . An innocent misrepresentation would be relevant only on the question of the ultimate relief which would be granted to the plaintiff [ Cadbury Schweppes v. Pub Squash , 1981 RPC 429 : ( 1981 ) 1 AIIER 213 : ( 1981 ) 1 WLR 193 ( PC ) ; Erven Warnink v. Townend , 1980 RPC 31 : ( 1979 ) 2 AIIER 927 : 1979 AC 731 ( HL ) ] ..... ” 10 ) The Division Bench essentially interfered with the judgment of the learned Single Judge on this score and also found that the learned Single Judge was incorrect in stating that “ reputation as to source is not sufficiently demonstrated ” .
