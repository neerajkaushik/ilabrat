assume acquiescence . We do not think this to be the position on facts and in law . A plea of acquiescence to be raised in defence so as to succeed ought to be supported by weighty materials to that effect . Since the learned single Judge has referred to the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of M / s Power Control Appliances and Ors . vs. Sumeet Machines Pvt . Ltd. , ( 1994 ) 2 SCC 448 , we would refer to it in some details . Paras 4 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 and 16 of this judgment were heavily relied upon by Mr. Tulzapurkar . In that , the facts and the submissions are summarised . Then , in para 20 , the argument of the respondents before the Hon’ble Supreme Court was set out . In paras 27 , 28 , 29 and 30 , the English judgments were noted and up to para 31 . Thereafter , the decisions rendered by our Hon’ble Supreme Court and other courts have been noted . 90 . We are in agreement with Mr. Tulzapurkar that even at this prima facie stage , there is no positive act which can be attributed to the plaintiff so as to deny the relief . There is no acquiescence which can be culled out . Beyond referring to some general principles , we do not find any material placed before the learned single Judge from which an inference of acquiescence can be drawn . Mr. Dwarkadas has , on this point , relied upon certain judgments and even in the written submissions , there is reference to general principles . All that the first defendant says is as under : “ ( ii ) The defence of the acquiescence is available to Respondent No . 1 since the plaintiff was aware of its right and the defendant was ignorant of its own right and despite the same , the plaintiff assents to or lays by in relation to the acts of the defendant and in view of the same , it would be unjust in all circumstances to grant the relief of injunction to the plaintiff . It is submitted that the requirements stand 12
