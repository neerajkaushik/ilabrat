aside the order . After going through the record we find that the appellants had made a request that their matter be heard at Bengaluru . Copies of the orders passed thereafter have been placed on record and the record does not show that the appellants were ever informed that their request for having the matter heard at Bengaluru was either accepted or rejected . Therefore , we are of the considered opinion that the National Commission erred in not issuing fresh notice to the appellants . Accordingly , the order of the National Commission is set aside and the matter is remitted to the National Commission for hearing the same on merits . 6 . Vide order dated 22.07.2016 while issuing notice we had directed the appellants to deposit the amount as awarded by the National Commission . The said amount shall remain in deposit and disbursal of the same shall abide by the final decision of the National Commission . 7 . The parties are directed to appear before the National Commission at Delhi on 12 February , 2018 .
