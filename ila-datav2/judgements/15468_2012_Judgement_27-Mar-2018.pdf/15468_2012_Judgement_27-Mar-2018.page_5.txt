award is not binding on them . They have , inter alia , alleged that the award is a false and fraudulent document . They also emphasized that the signature of Anilkumar Patel in the arbitral award showing his acknowledgement was forged and therefore , could not be acted upon . 7 . Later on , an application came to be filed by Anilkumar Patel for himself and on behalf of his family members for an amendment under Order VI Rule 17 C.P.C. stating that the arbitration petition No.202 of 2005 filed initially , did not contain the challenge to award dated 03.11.1996 and hence , by an amendment sought to challenge award dated 03.11.1996 as well . The said application was dismissed on 30.06.2006 by the District Court on the ground of limitation which was further challenged through W.P. No.5502 of 2006 before the High Court . The same was remanded to the District Judge on 21.08.2006 for consideration of the matter afresh . After remand , the District Judge by order dated 28.09.2006 again dismissed the amendment application on the ground of limitation . The said order dated 28.09.2006 was again challenged by Anilkumar Patel under W.P. No.7614 of 2006 . The High Court vide order dated 13.11.2006 dismissed the writ petition observing that Anilkumar Patel is adopting tactics of approbate and reprobate and Anilkumar Patel is acting as per his convenience by denying the knowledge of award dated 03.11.1996 in some court proceedings 5
