2 4 . These appeals are , hence , disposed of in terms of the Settlement Agreement dated 04.10.2018 , which shall form part of this Judgment . 5 . The learned counsel appearing for Respondent Nos.9 to 13 submits that they may also be permitted to pursue their claim for a share . We are afraid , the submission can not be accepted . We find from the proceedings that Respondent Nos . 9 to 13 have never contested their claims , either in the trial court or in the High Court , apparently , as the learned counsel has rightly submitted that they were more interested in maintaining the spirit of unity , peace and harmony in the family . 6 . We record our â€™ sincere appreciation for the strenuous efforts taken by Mr. Jitender Mohan Sharma , learned senior counsel , in settling the disputes between the parties . 7 . Let the decree be drawn up accordingly . [ A.M. KHANWILKAR ] New Delhi ; OCTOBER 05 , 2018 .
