5 In terms of the directions issued by this Court an inquiry has been conducted by the Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas . A copy of the report has been placed on record . The inquiry has not resulted in any conclusive determination on the allegations set out in paragraph 9 of the petition . 6 Basically , the issue as to whether the second respondent owns multiple dealerships or outlets for petroleum products , in violation of the applicable rules and regulations , has to be determined by the oil company or companies concerned with the issue . None of the oil companies were impleaded to these proceedings . In their absence , it would not be possible for the Court to make any factual determination . Whether an individual holds a dealership or outlet benami would turn on an appreciation of factual material which can not be inquired into in the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 32 . Consequently all that we observe is that it would be open to the petitioner to bring such material as she has in her possession to the attention of the concerned oil companies for such action as is deemed necessary . We clarify that we have not expressed any opinion on the merits of such a claim , which is left open to be determined in accordance with law , after hearing all necessary parties . 7 On the second aspect of the matter which has been adverted in the order of this Court dated 26 August 2016 , it would be necessary to set out the contents of the affidavit filed before this Court on 6 October 2016 by the Ministry
