15 default , to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a further period of one year . For that no special reason has been recorded by the Trial Court . Considering the nature of offence and the trivial reason for which the appellant got enraged and assaulted Hitesh Thakur , that too by a knife and also gave multiple blows , does not warrant a light punishment . We would , however , accept the argument of the respondents that in the fact situation of the present case , the sentence period should not be less than 10 years imprisonment with fine . That would meet the ends of justice . 16 . Accordingly , we partly allow these Criminal Appeal Nos.75 and 227 of 2015 filed by original accused No.1 Atul Thakur . We modify the impugned judgment of the High Court against the appellant in respect of nature of offence and instead restore the order of the Trial Court in that behalf . The appellant is held guilty for an offence punishable under Section 304 Part - II of IPC and is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 ( Ten ) years with fine of Rs.10,000/- ( Rupees Ten Thousand ) , in default to undergo further imprisonment for one year . Needless to mention that the appellant shall be entitled to set off under Section 428 of the Code of Criminal Procedure .
