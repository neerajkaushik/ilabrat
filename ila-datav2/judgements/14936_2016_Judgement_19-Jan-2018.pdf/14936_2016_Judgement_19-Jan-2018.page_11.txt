11 the incident happened on account of sudden fight between the friends who had gathered for a drink party arranged at the behest of Hitesh Thakur . There was no pre - mediation and the act done by the appellant was in the heat of passion without the appellant taking any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner . The number of wounds caused by the appellant , it is a well established position , by itself can not be a decisive factor . The High Court committed manifest error in being influenced by the said fact . What is relevant is that the occurrence was sudden and not premeditated and the offender acted in the heat of passion . The evidence supports the case of the appellant in this behalf . The fact that the appellant used weapon such as knife , is also not a decisive factor to attract Section 302 of IPC . Neither the use of a knife in the commission of offence nor the factum of multiple injuries given by the appellant would deny the appellant of the benefit of Exception 4 . 13 . Dealing with a somewhat similar situation , in the case of Surain Singh Vs . State of Punjab 7 , this Court has restated the settled legal position about the purport of Exception 4 to Section 1 ( 2017 ) 5 SCC 796
