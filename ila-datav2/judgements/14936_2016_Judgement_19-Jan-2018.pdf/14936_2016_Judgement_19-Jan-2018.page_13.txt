13 that there was a physical fight between the deceased and the accused Atul , can not be denied because it has come in the evidence of PW-11 Himanshu , PW-12 Manoj Bansal and PW-1 Ashutosh that a physical fight has taken place between them . In these circumstances , this Court will have to examine the prosecution evidence whether the accused Atul had taken an undue advantage or acted in a cruel or inimical manner so as to deprive him of the benefit of exception 4 of Section 300 . In fact , the prosecution could not prove any motive for killing the deceased by the accused . The drinking session in the room of the accused Mukesh Thakur was by mutual consent . From these circumstances , it can be held that the incident in question took place in a sudden fight in the heat of possession . The next question which arises for consideration is whether the accused Atul did take an undue advantage of the said fight or acted in a cruel or inimical manner . Keeping in view the fact that both the deceased and accused had consumed considerable amount of alcohol which is established from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses , it can not be altogether ruled out that the stab injuries inflicted were not with an intention of taking undue advantage by the accused Atul . It is probable that in an inebriated condition the accused inflicted the injuries because of the physical fight between them . Moreover , keeping in view the nature of the injuries noticed by Dr. Sandeep Kaushik in the MLC Ext . PW-18 / A , it is difficult to accept the accused Atul Thakur intended to cause the death of Hitesh or that the injuries were so dangerous that they would in all probability , cause death . Nevertheless , the injuries were quite serious , the accused can surely by credited with the knowledge that if an injury is caused with a knife on the chest or abdomen of a person then this act is likely to cause the death of the victim .
