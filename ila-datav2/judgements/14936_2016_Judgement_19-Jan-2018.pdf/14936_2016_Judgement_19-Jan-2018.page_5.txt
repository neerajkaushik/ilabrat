5 co - accused , as the genesis of the offence is doubtful . Further , the involvement of the appellant in the commission of crime has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt . He took us through the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and also of the defence witness ( DW1 ) who was examined at the instance of the appellant . He submits that in any case , the fact situation established by the prosecution , even if taken as it is , does not warrant a finding of commission of offence of murder of Hitesh Thakur . At best it is a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder , covered by the Exception under Section 300 of IPC and , thus , punishable under second part of Section 304 of IPC . The Trial Court had justly invoked that offence and sentenced the appellant to undergo five years rigorous imprisonment which the appellant has already undergone . He , therefore , submits that this appeal be allowed and the appellant be set free by reviving the order of the Sessions Court and setting aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court . He submits that the appellant has already undergone sentence for a period of 7 years 3 months 24 days as on 24 ‚Äù November , 2017 including remission period of one year 2 months and 6 days .
