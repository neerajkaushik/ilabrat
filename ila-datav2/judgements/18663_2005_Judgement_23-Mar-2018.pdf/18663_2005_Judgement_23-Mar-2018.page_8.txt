Kurubarahalli in favour of President of India by a registered gift - deed dated 12.8.1965 ( Annexure P-1 ) and that the said land was leased in favour of the University by the President of India by a deed of lease dated 30.11.1970 ( Annexure P-2 ) . The land did not belong to the Maharaja of Mysore on the appointed date . Neither the University nor the Government of India was made party to the proceedings before the Land Tribunal . But , Mysore Palace was made a party which has nothing to do with the land when the alleged application was made for grant of occupancy right . The KLR Act has no application to the lands belonging to the Government or held on lease by a University having regard to Section 107 of the said Act . 15 . It is further argued that the private respondents are not in possession of the schedule property . Possession of the land is and has been with the University . Upon discovery of the fraud perpetuated by the private respondents , the University by way of I.A Nos.12 - 15 of 2010 and the State of Karnataka by way of written statement along with the affidavit , placed the relevant documents on record before this Court as far back as in the years 2010 - 12 . The private respondents have not placed on record any rebuttable documents . It is argued that the University has also assigned justifiable reasons for the delay in approaching the High Court for quashing the order of the Land Tribunal . The High Court has , however , failed to accept the said reasons .
