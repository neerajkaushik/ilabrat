10 of India for starting Logopedics Institute in Mysore as per registered gift - deed at Annexure P-1 , dated 12.8.1965 . Since the land was not suitable for the said purpose , Union of India requested the University of Mysore to give some other land and accordingly the University gave 32 acres of its land . In lieu of the same , the Union of India leased 22 acres of the said land for 99 years commencing from 30.11.1997 in favour of the University . This is evident from the registered lease deed at Annexure P-2 dated 30.11.1970 . It was a vacant land . The schedule properties are a part and parcel of the said land . It is thus clear that the University was the lessee of the said land . 20 . This takes us to the next question as to whether Rajaiah and Nanjaiah had made applications for grant of occupancy right in respect of the schedule lands and whether the order of the Land Tribunal at Annexure P-3 dated 5.6.1981 is in respect of the said lands . The University and the State Government have contended that the contesting respondents have managed to create bogus documents to their advantage in relation to the land in question . In order to test the correctness of this submission , we have verified the original records produced by the learned Additional Advocate General representing the State Government in relation to the properties in question . The order dated 5.6.1981 of the Land Tribunal at Annexure P-3 shows that the Land Tribunal passed the order granting occupancy right at Annexure P-3 in KL / RF/4480/79 - 80 and 4481/79 - 80 .
