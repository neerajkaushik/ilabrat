Union of India ’ wherein this Court has held that expressions ‘ pertaining to ’ , ‘ in relation to ’ and ‘ arising out of used in the deeming provisions , are used in an expansive sense . It also referred to the judgment of this Court in CIT v. Walfort Share and Stock Brokers P Ltd. * wherein this Court has held that the basic principle of taxation is to tax the net income , i.e. , gross income minus the expenditure and on the same analogy the exemption is also in respect of net income . In other words , where the gross income would not form part of total income , it 's associated or related expenditure would also not be permitted to be debited against other taxable income . 17 ) Likewise , explaining the meaning of ‘ expenditure incurred ’ , the High Court agreed that this expression would mean incurring of actual expenditure and not to some imagined expenditure . At the same time , observed the High Court , the ‘ actual ’ expenditure that is in contemplation under section 14A(1 ) of the said Act is the ‘ actual ’ expenditure in relation to or in connection with or pertaining to exempt income . The corollary to this is that if no expenditure is incurred in relation to the exempt income , no disallowance can be made under section 14A of the said Act . On the basis of the aforesaid discussion , the High Court answered the question formulated by it in the affirmative . ( 1988 ) 2 SCC 299 ( 2010 ) 326 ITR 1 ( SC )
