41 Taking note of the aforesaid finding of fact , the High Court has dismissed the appeal of the assessee observing as under : “ In the present case , after examining the balance - sheet of the assessee , a finding of fact has been recorded that the funds utilized by the assessee being mixed funds , therefore , the interest paid by the assessee is also an interest on the investments made . Such being a finding of fact , we do not find that any substantial question of law arises for consideration of this Court . ” After going through the records and applying the principle of apportionment , which is held to be applicable in such cases , we do not find any merit in Civil Appeal No . 1423 of 2015 , which is accordingly dismissed . 43 ) Few appeals are filed by the Revenue against the assessees which pertained to the period prior to the introduction of Rule 8D of the Rules . Here , the case is decided in favour of the assessees also on the ground that Rule 8D of the Rules is prospective in nature and could not have been made applicable in respect of the Assessment Years prior to 2007 when this Rule was inserted . This view has already been upheld by this Court in Civil Appeal No . 2165 of 2012 ( Commissioner of Income Tax , Mumbai v. M / s . Essar Teleholdings Ltd. through its Manager ) , pronounced on January 31 , 2018 , that the said Rule is prospective in nature . On this ground alone , these appeals of the Revenue fail as it is not necessary to go into the other issues .
