14 the purpose of these appeals , it is only question No . 1 which is relevant , and formulation thereof by the High Court was as under : “ 4 . Whether expenditure ( including interest paid on funds borrowed ) in respect of investment in shares of operating companies for acquiring and retaining a controlling interest therein is hit by section 14A of the Income tax Act , 1961 inasmuch as the dividend received on such shares does not form part of the total income ? ” 15 ) On facts , it was noted that the assessee company is in the business of finance , investment and was dealing in shares and securities . The assessee held shares and securities , partly as investments on the “ capital account ” and partly as “ trading assets ” for the purpose of acquiring and retaining control over its group companies , primarily Max India Ltd. As per the assessee , any profit resulting on the sale of shares held as trading assets was duly offered to tax as business income of the assessee . During the previous year relevant to the assessment year 2002 - 03 , the assessee incurred total interest expenditure of Rs . 1,61,21,168/- , which was claimed as business expenditure under section 36(1)(iii ) of the Income Tax Act , 1961 ( hereinafter referred to as “ the said act ” ) . According to the assessee , the expenditure claimed was not hit by section 14A of the Act , on the ground that although borrowed funds were partly utilised for investment in shares held as trading assets , such investment was made with the intention to acquire and retain a controlling interest in the aforesaid company and that the receipt of dividend thereon was merely incidental .
