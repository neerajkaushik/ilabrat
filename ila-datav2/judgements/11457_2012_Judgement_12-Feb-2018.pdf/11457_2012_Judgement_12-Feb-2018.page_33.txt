33 which is includible in total income that has to be disallowed . If an expenditure incurred has no causal connection with the exempted income , then such an expenditure would obviously be treated as not related to the income that is exempted from tax , and such expenditure would be allowed as business expenditure . To put it differently , such expenditure would then be considered as incurred in respect of other income which is to be treated as part of the total income . 33 ) There is no quarrel in assigning this meaning to section 14A of the Act . In fact , all the High Courts , whether it is the Delhi High Court on the one hand or the Punjab and Haryana High Court on the other hand , have agreed in providing this interpretation to section 14A of the Act . The entire dispute is as to what interpretation is to be given to the words ‘ in relation to ’ in the given scenario , viz . where the dividend income on the shares is earned , though the dominant purpose for subscribing in those shares of the investee company was not to earn dividend . We have two scenarios in these sets of appeals . In one group of cases the main purpose for investing in shares was to gain control over the investee company . Other cases are those where the shares of investee company were held by the assessees as stock - in - trade ( i.e. as a business activity ) and not as investment to earn dividends . In this context , it is to be examined as to whether the expenditure was incurred , in respective scenarios , in relation to the dividend income or not .
