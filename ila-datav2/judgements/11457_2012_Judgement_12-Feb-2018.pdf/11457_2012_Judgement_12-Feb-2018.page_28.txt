28 Sons read as under : â€œ 6 . Mr. Sarkar , the learned advocate appearing on behalf of the revenue , has , on the other hand , supported the order passed by the Tribunal and has contended that the assessee itself having failed to produce material in support of its contention , the Assessing Officer rightly assessed the deductible income on proportionate basis . Mr. Sarkar submits that the same is in conformity with Rule 8D of the Income tax Rule and thus , we should not interfere with the order passed by the Tribunal . 7 . After hearing the learned counsel appearing for the parties and after going through the materials on record and the decisions cited by Mr. Khaitan , we find that the Supreme Court in the cases of CIT v.

In our opinion , the mere fact that those shares were old ones and not acquired recently is immaterial . It is for the assessee to show the source of acquisition of those shares by production of materials that those were acquired from the funds available in the hands of the assessee at the relevant point of time without taking benefit of any loan . If those shares were purchased from the amount taken in loan , even for instance , five or ten years ago , it is for the assessee to show by the production of documentary evidence that such loaned
