21 applying the formula contained in Rule 8D holding that Section 14A would be applicable . The CIT(A ) issued notice of enhancement under Section 251 of the Act and held that in view of Section 14A of the Act , the assessee was not to be allowed any deduction in respect of income which is not chargeable to tax . Therefore , he disallowed the entire expenditure claimed instead of restricting the disallowance to the amount which was claimed as exempt income as done by the AO . The ITAT set aside the order of the AO as well as CIT(A ) . It referred to a CBDT Circular No.18/2015 dated 02.11.2015 which states that income arising from investment of a banking concern is attributable to the business of banking which falls under the head “ Profits and gains of business and profession ” . The circular states that shares and stock held by the bank are ‘ stock - in - trade ’ and not ‘ investment ’ . Referring to certain judgments ( which we will also refer to ) and the earlier orders of the Tribunal , it was held that if shares are held as stock - in - trade and not as investment even the disallowance under rule 8D would be nil as rule 8D(2)(i ) would be confined to direct expenses for earning the tax exempt income . In the aforesaid factual backdrop , in appeal filed by the Revenue , the High Court noted that following substantial question of law arose for consideration : “ Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case , the Hon'ble ITAT is right in law in deleting the addition made on account of disallowance under section 14A of the Income Tax Act , 1961 ? ”
