39 affirming the view of the ITAT , though we are not subscribing to the theory of dominant intention applied by the High Court . It is to be kept in mind that in those cases where shares are held as ‘ stock - in - trade ’ , it becomes a business activity of the assessee to deal in those shares as a business proposition . Whether dividend is earned or not becomes immaterial . In fact , it would be a quirk of fate that when the investee company declared dividend , those shares are held by the assessee , though the assessee has to ultimately trade those shares by selling them to earn profits . The situation here is , therefore , different from the case like Maxopp Investment Ltd. where the assessee would continue to hold those shares as it wants to retain control over the investee company . In that case , whenever dividend is declared by the investee company that would necessarily be earned by the assessee and the assessee alone . Therefore , even at the time of investing into those shares , the assessee knows that it may generate dividend income as well and as and when such dividend income is generated that would be earned by the assessee . In contrast , where the shares are held as stock - in - trade , this may not be necessarily a situation . The main purpose is to liquidate those shares whenever the share price goes up in order to earn profits . In the result , the appeals filed by the Revenue challenging the judgment of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in State Bank of Patiala also fail , though law in this respect has been clarified
