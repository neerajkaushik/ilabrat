We are of the opinion that the dominant purpose for which the investment into shares is made by an assessee may not be relevant . No doubt , the assessee like Maxopp Investment Limited may have made the investment in order to gain control of the investee company . However , that does not appear to be a relevant factor in determining the issue at hand . Fact remains that such dividend income is non - taxable . In this scenario , if expenditure is incurred on earning the dividend income , that much of the expenditure which is attributable to the dividend income has to be disallowed and can not be treated as business expenditure . Keeping this objective behind Section14A of the Act in mind , the said provision has to be interpreted , particularly , the word ‘ in relation to the income ’ that does not form part of total income . Considered in this hue , the principle of apportionment of expenses comes into play as that is the principle which is engrained in Section 14A of the Act .
