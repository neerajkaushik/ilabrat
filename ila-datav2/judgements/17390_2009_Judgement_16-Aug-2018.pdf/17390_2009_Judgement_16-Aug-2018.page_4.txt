4 accused nos . 1 and 2 came to his residence on the night of 07.07.2003 and cloth of accused no . 2 was blood stained . PW-4 further stated that when he questioned accused No . 1 , he stated that they were travelling in an auto towards Karthikere , it toppled and in that process they sustained injuries . The above said evidence of PW-4 explaining the blood stains on the cloth of accused no . 2 due to toppling of auto does not advance case of the prosecution that A-1 conspired with A-2 who committed the murder â€™ of deceased Mohan Kumar . In any event extra judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence , which can not form basis for conviction and unless supported by other substantive evidence , which is lacking in this case . 10 . Insofar as accused _ no . 3 is concerned , prosecution relies upon exhibit P-8 and P-9 . Photographs were recovered on the disclosure statement of accused no . 3 . In this regard , prosecution has examined PW-12 ( photographer ) who has stated that accused nos . 1 and 3 came to his studio and took joint photographs ( Exhibit P-8 & P-9 ) . The said photographs at the most may only show that A-1 and A-3 has illicit relationship . There is no evidence adduced to prove that A-3 had hatched conspiracy with A-2 to commit the murder of Mohan Kumar .
