11 . 12 , proceed ex - parte against the respondents and heard the matter in their absence . Mr. Amar Dave , learned counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that the reason given by the High Court in condoning the delay was totally erroneous inasmuch as Writ of Summons were served upon the respondents immediately after the filing of the suit and not in the year 2009 as mentioned . It was further argued that , in any case , even if when the summons were served in the year 2009 , there was no satisfactory explanation submitted by the respondents seeking condonation of delay which was more than 5 years 54 days even on counting the period from the year 2009 . He also submitted that the High Court failed to notice that , on identical grounds , Notice of Motion No . 1212 of 2015 in Suit No . 4780 of 1999 for condonation of delay in filing the written statement was filed by the respondents which was dismissed by the learned Single Judge and that order was affirmed by the Division Bench ( and now even by this Court ) . While dealing with the instant matter , the High Court failed to consider those orders passed by the co - ordinate Benches . We find force and due merit in the aforesaid submissions of the learned counsel for the appellant . Civil Appeal Nos . 4266 - 4267 of 2018 Page 11 of 15
