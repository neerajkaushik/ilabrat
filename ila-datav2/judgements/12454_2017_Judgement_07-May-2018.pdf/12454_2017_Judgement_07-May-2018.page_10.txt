As is clear from the above , the circumstance which weighed with the High Court in condoning the delay was that though the suit was filed in the year 2000 , summons were served only in the year 2009 . Plea of the appellant that summons were actually served in the year 2000 itself was not accepted . On this basis , the High Court came to the conclusion that since appellant itself took time of 9 years after institution or following of the suit , to serve the summons upon the respondents herein , equities were balanced by allowing the respondents to file the written statement , more so , when no irreparable loss or prejudice was caused to the appellant and no case of mala fides was made out against the respondents . 10 . Notice in the Special Leave Petition was issued on July 18 , 2017 which was duly served upon all the five respondents . However , none of the respondents have entered appearance . Accordingly , the Registry processed the matter for listing before the Court and it was listed for hearing on March 26 , 2018 . On that day also , nobody appeared on behalf of the respondents . Still in order to give one more opportunity , the matter was directed to be listed after three weeks . It again came up for hearing on April 20 , 2018 . Since respondents failed to appear in spite of all the aforesaid chances given to them , this Court is left with no option but to Civil Appeal Nos . 4266 - 4267 of 2018 Page 10 of 15
