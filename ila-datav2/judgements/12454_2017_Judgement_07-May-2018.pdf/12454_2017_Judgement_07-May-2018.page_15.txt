1908 are procedural in nature and , therefore , hand maid of justice . However , that would not mean that the defendant has right to take as much time as he wants in filing the written statement , without giving convincing and cogent reasons for delay and the High Court has to condone it mechanically . It is also to be borne in mind that when the matter was listed on January 29 , 2015 , it was specifically recorded that no written statement was filed and the two suits were adjourned for ex - parte decree . In other suit i.e. Suit No . 3813 of 2000 , similar Notice of Motion seeking condonation of delay was rejected though it contained same kind of explanation and that order has been upheld till this Court . On this ground also , there was no reason to take a contrary view in the instant matter when both the suits were taken up together and proceed simultaneously . 18 . We accordingly allow these appeals , set aside the impugned order and dismiss Notice of Motion No . 1212 of 2015 . No cost . stanewenwwawverewannmanencemeenanaNaNTRN TERE J. ( A.K.
