13 . 14 . We shall proceed on the basis that summons in Suit No . 4870 of 1999 were served only in the year 2009 . In this behalf , it may be stated that in this suit , unconditional leave to defend was granted by the learned Single Judge on March 16 , 2002 . By the same order , all three suits were directed to be tried together . Therefore , Vakalatnama in the suit was also filed and on the dates fixed before the Court , respondents were appearing having knowledge about the Suit No . 4870 of 1999 as well . Obviously , this leave to defend was granted after the respondents had put in appearance and filed application for grant of leave to defend . Thus , summons in the suit were served upon the respondents , albeit , in Form 4 of Appendix B , as stipulated in Rule 2 of Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 . May be , thereafter , Writ of Summons were not served again upon the respondents . However , in any case , these summons were served in the year 2009 . Therefore , it was incumbent upon the respondents to show as to in what manner they were prevented from filing the written statement . It has to be borne in mind that as per the provisions of Order VIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 , the defendant is obligated to present a written statement of his defence within thirty days from the date of service of summons .
