Joseph Salvaraj A. v. State of Gujarat ’ . In the case of Joseph Salvaraj A. ( supra ) , this Court while deciding the question whether the High Court could entertain the 482 petition for quashing of FIR , when the charge sheet was filed by the police during the pendency of the 482 petition , observed :   “ 16 . Thus , from the general conspectus of the various sections under which the appellant is being charged and is to be prosecuted would show that the same are not made out even prima facie from the complainant ’s FIR . Even if the charge - sheet had been filed , the learned Single Judge could have still examined whether the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant were prima facie made out from the complainant ’s FIR , chargesheet , documents , etc . or not . ” 16 . Even otherwise it must be remembered that the provision invoked by the accused before the High Court is Section 482 Cr . PC and that this Court is hearing an appeal from an order under Section 482 of Cr . P.C. Section 482 of Cr . P.C reads as follows :   “ 482 . Saving of inherent power of the High Court.- Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of the High Court to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under this Code , or to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice . ” 17 . There is nothing in the words of this Section which restricts the exercise of the power of the Court to prevent the abuse of process of court or miscarriage of justice only to the stage of the FIR . It is settled principle of law that the High court can exercise jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr . P.C even when the discharge application is pending 2 ( 2011 ) 7 SCC 59
