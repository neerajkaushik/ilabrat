Having given our anxious consideration , we are of the view that assuming that there is a security deposit of Rs . One Crore and that he has misappropriated the dispute between the two parties can only be a civil dispute . 25 . In Indian Oil Corporation v. NEPC India Ltd. and others “ , this Court observed as follows : “ 13 . ee Any effort to settle civil disputes and claims , which do not involve any criminal offence , by applying pressure through criminal prosecution should be deprecated = and discouraged ..... ” The Court noticed a growing trend in business circles to convert purely civil dispute into criminal cases . We find it strange that the complainant has not made any attempt for the recovery of the money of Rs . One Crore except by filing this criminal complaint . This action appears to be mala fide and unsustainable . 26 . In State of Haryana and Ors . v. Bhajan Lal and Ors . ° , this Court has set out the categories of cases in which the inherent power under Section 482 of Cr . PC . can be exercised . Para 102 of the judgment reads as follows :   4 2006 ( 6 ) SCC 736 5 ( 1992 ) Supp ( 1 ) SCC 335 12
