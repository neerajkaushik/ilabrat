with the trial court ? . Indeed , it would be a travesty to hold that proceedings initiated against a person can be interfered with at the stage of FIR but not if it has advanced , and the allegations have materialized into a charge sheet . On the contrary it could be said that the abuse of process caused by FIR stands aggravated if the FIR has taken the form of a charge sheet after investigation . The power is undoubtedly conferred to prevent abuse of process of power of any court . 18 . The second submission of learned counsel for the Respondent No.2 is that the Appellant No.1 has fraudulently transferred the property which is the subject matter of the agreement dated 03.06.1993 to his wife and has thereby committed criminal breach of trust . This charge is wholly untenable and rather extraordinary since the alleged fraudulent transfer of property by the Appellant No.1 to his wife , assuming it to be illegal , by no stretch of imagination can constitute the offence of a criminal breach of trust , since the property was not entrusted by the Respondent No.2 to the Appellants . The property belonged to Appellant No.1 and there was therefore no question of Appellants having been entrusted with their own property , and that too by the complainant , who had merely entered into a development agreement in respect of the property . 19 . Lastly , we find that the FIR and the charge sheet essentially charged the petitioner for an offence under Section 406 of the Cr . P.C. 3 G. Sagar Suri and Anr . V. State of U.P and Others , ( 2000 ) 2 SCC 636 ( Para 7 ) . Umesh Kumar V. State of Andhra Pradesh and Anr . ( 2013 ) 10 SCC 591 ( Para 20 ) 8
