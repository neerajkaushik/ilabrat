designed to achieve a salutary public purpose which is that a court proceeding ought not to be permitted to degenerate into a weapon of harassment or persecution . In a criminal case , the veiled object behind a lame prosecution , the very nature of the material on which the structure of the prosecution rests and the like would justify the High Court in quashing the proceeding in the interest of justice ..... ‚Äù 28 . We find that the prosecution is mala fide , untenable and solely intended to harass the Appellants . We are forfeited in view of the Respondent not having made any attempt to recover the deposit of Rs . One Crore through a civil action . 29 . We have , therefore , no hesitation in quashing the FIR and the charge sheet filed against the Appellants . Hence , the FIR No.0139/2014 dated 20.08.2014 and charge sheet dated 03.08.2018 are hereby quashed . 30 . For the aforesaid reasons , we hereby set aside the impugned judgment and order dated 02.02.2016 of High Court of Delhi . Accordingly , appeal is allowed along with the application filed by the Appellants seeking amendment of main prayer . NEW DELHI NOVEMBER 15 , 2018 15
