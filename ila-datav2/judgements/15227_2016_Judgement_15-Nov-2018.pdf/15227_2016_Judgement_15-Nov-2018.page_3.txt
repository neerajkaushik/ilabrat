where the property is situated . ( See New Delhi Municipal Council v. Tanvi Trading and Credit Private Limited ) â€™ . 5 . Thereafter , on 14.03.2011 , the Appellant No.1 wrote a letter stating that he does not wish to develop the property . The Appellants did not take any further action neither did they return the amount advanced by the Respondent No.2 . 6 . Apparently , since the Appellant had declined all alternate offers made by the complainant but ostensibly on the ground that this security amount of Rs . One crore had not been refunded , Respondent No.2 on 19.11.2011 filed a Criminal Complaint before the SHO , Police Station Barakhamba Road , New Delhi complaining of offences under Section 406 and 420 followed by a complaint dated 10.09.2012 with the Additional Commissioner of Police . On refusal of police authorities to register FIR against the Appellants , the Respondent - complainant invoked powers of the Court under Section 156 ( 3 ) of the Cr . RC on 03.11.2012 . Thereafter , on 11.11.2013 Respondent No . 2 withdrew the complaint filed under Section 156 ( 3 ) . The FIR with which we are concerned was lodged on 20.08.2014 against the Appellants for offence under Section 406 of IPC on a fresh complaint filed by the Respondent No.2 . 7 . Following which , the Appellants approached the High Court under Section 482 of the Cr . PC seeking to quash FIR dated 20.08.2014 . According to the Appellants , the FIR was completely untenable in the 1 2008 ( 8) SCC 765
