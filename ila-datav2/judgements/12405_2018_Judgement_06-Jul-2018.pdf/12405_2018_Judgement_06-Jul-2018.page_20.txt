16 . In this aforesaid backdrop , we have to consider the principal submission of the petitioner viz . whether the expression ‘ Chief Justice ’ in the Supreme Court Rules is to be read as ‘ Collegium ’ of first five Judges ? As a corollary , whether power of constituting the Benches and listing the cases be exercised by the Collegium and not the Chief Justice alone ? That is the entire edifice on which the petitioner ’s case is built upon . To begin with , we may remark that Asok Pande covers this issue as well . That judgment was rendered in a writ petition filed by the petitioner under Article 32 of the Constitution wherein he had raised number of grievances . Apart from some personal grievances raised in the said writ petition pertaining to some proceedings in the Allahabad High Court , relief which he had sought was for issuance of writ of mandamus to the first respondent ( Supreme Court of India ) to evolve the set of procedure for constituting the Benches and allotment of jurisdiction to different Benches of the Supreme Court . In this behalf , he wanted that there should be a specific rule in the Rules to the effect that the three Judge Bench in the Chief Justice ’s Court should consist of the Chief Justice and two senior - most Judges and also that Rules be made to the effect that the Constitution Bench shall consist of five senior - most Judges or three senior most Judges and two junior - most Judges .
