27 . As already taken note of above , the basis of this argument is the judgment of this Court in Second Judges â€™ case which laid the foundation of the Collegium system for the appointment of Judges . The relevant passages from the said judgment , which are relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the petitioner , have already been extracted above . The Court accepted that there has to be room for discretionary authority within the operation of rule of law . At the same time , it was emphasised that such a discretion should be reduced to minimum extent necessary for proper governance , which can be achieved with the existence of proper guidelines or norms of general application . In this hue , the Court deemed it proper that conferment of the discretionary authority should not be with one individual but to a body of men and , thus , evolved the system of Collegium whereby the Chief Justice will have benefit of full interaction and effective consultation with other senior Judges , to ensure projection of all likely points and procuring the element of plurality in the final decision with the benefit of collective wisdom of all those involved in the process . However , it needs to be emphasised that the aforesaid resolution and concept of Collegium was innovated by judicial interpretation in the context of appointment of Judges in the constitutional Courts , i.e. the Supreme Court as well as the Writ Petition ( C ) No . of 2018 Page 30 of 41 ( arising out of Diary No . 12405 of 2018 )
