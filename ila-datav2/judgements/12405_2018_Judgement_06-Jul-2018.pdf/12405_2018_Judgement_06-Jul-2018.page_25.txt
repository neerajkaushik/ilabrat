retirements have to be borne in mind since the assignment given to a judge who is due to demit office would have to be entrusted to another Bench when the vacancy arises . These are some of the considerations which are borne in mind . The Chief Justice is guided by the need to ensure the orderly functioning of the court and the expeditious disposal of cases . The publication of the roster on the websites of the High Courts provides notice to litigants and lawyers about the distribution of judicial work under the authority of the Chief Justice . This Court was constituted in 1950 . In the preparation of the roster and in the distribution of judicial work , some of the conventions which are adopted in the High Courts are also relevant , subject to modifications having regard to institutional requirements . ” 20 . The aforesaid judgment of the three Judges ’ Bench is a binding precedent . This judgment , in no uncertain terms , holds that the ‘ Chief Justice ’ in his individual capacity is the Master of Roster and it can not read as Collegium of first three or five Judges . Thus , it is his prerogative to constitute the Benches and allocate the subjects which would be dealt with by the respective Benches . 21 . The Constitution is silent on the role of the ‘ Chief Justice’ ® . There is no specific provision relating thereto either in the Constitution or even in any other law . The legal position contained in the aforesaid judgments is based upon healthy practice and sound conventions which have been developed over a period of time and that stands engrafted in the Supreme Court Rules . In fact , it 9 Article 124 of the Constitution merely says that there shall be a Supreme Court of India consisting of Chief Justice of India and thirty other Judges .
