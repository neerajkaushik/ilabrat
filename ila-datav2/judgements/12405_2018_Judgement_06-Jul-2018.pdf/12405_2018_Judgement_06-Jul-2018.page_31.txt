It is also to be borne in mind that as far as the Executive is concerned , it will have virtually no role in such appointments , except the minimalist role specifically delineated in the judgment . This kind of system which is devised for appointment of Judges can not be replicated when it comes to the role of the Chief Justice as Master of Roster . We have to keep in mind that the Chief Justice , as the head of the Supreme Court of India , and the Chief Justices of the High Courts , have to perform many other functions , on administrative side , in their capacities as Chief Justices . Framing of the Roster and constituting the Benches is one among them . In case the expression ‘ Chief Justice ’ is to be interpreted as ‘ Collegium ’ , it would be difficult to have smooth day to day functioning of the Supreme Court , or for that matter the High Courts . We have already reproduced above that part of the discussion from the judgment in Asok Pande which took note of various factors that are to be kept in mind for preparing the Roster and indicating the constitution of Benches . Moreover , when it comes to assigning the cases to a particular Bench , it has to be undertaken by the Chief Justice on daily basis in contrast with the meetings of the Collegium for the purpose of appointment of Judges , which is infrequent .
