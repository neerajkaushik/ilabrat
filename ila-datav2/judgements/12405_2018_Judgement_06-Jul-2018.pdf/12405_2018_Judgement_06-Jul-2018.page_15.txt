important matters , pointed out the learned Attorney General . He submitted that the substance of the argument of the learned senior counsel for the petitioner was that in order to ensure that the cases are assigned in a fair and transparent manner , the term ‘ Chief Justice ’ should be interpreted to mean ‘ Collegium ’ of five senior most judges including the ‘ Chief Justice ’ . Response of the learned Attorney General was that though such a mechanism , as a solution , was found out by this Court in the judgments popularly known as Three Judges ’ case(s ) for appointment of Judges in the High Court as well as in the Supreme Court , suggestion was totally impractical when it comes to discharge of administrative duties by the ‘ Chief Justice ’ in his capacity as the Master of Roster . Strongly refuting this suggestion , he argued that such an interpretation was not only impractical , it would even result in a chaos if day to day administrative work , including the task of constituting the Benches and allocating cases to the Benches , is allowed to be undertaken by the ‘ Collegium ’ . His submission was that such matters of constituting the Benches and allocating cases to the respective Benches has to be left to the sole discretion of the ‘ Chief Justice ’ acting in his individual capacity , for the smooth functioning of the Court , by reposing faith and trust in Writ Petition ( C ) No . of 2018 Page 15 of 41 ( arising out of Diary No . 12405 of 2018 )
