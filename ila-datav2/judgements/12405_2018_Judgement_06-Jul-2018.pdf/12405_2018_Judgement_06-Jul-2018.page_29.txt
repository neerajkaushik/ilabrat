25 . 26 . From the aforesaid , it follows that the two most obvious functions of the ‘ Chief Justice ’ are to exercise judicial power as a Judge of the Court on equal footing as others , being ‘ among equals ’ and to assume responsibility of the administration of the Court . Keeping in mind these postulates and the ratio of the aforesaid binding judgments , it is difficult to accept the argument of the petitioner that the expression ‘ Chief Justice ’ is to be read as ‘ Collegium ’ consisting of five senior - most Judges , including the Chief Justice . The judgments cited by learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner are in the context of Article 124 of the Constitution wherein the expression ‘ Chief Justice ’ was read as Collegium , after examining the Constitutional Scheme and the objective behind such a provision meant for appointment of Judges . The rationale provided in that context can not be adopted while interpreting Article 145 of the Constitution , the purpose whereof is altogether different . We agree with the submission of the learned Attorney General that the task of constitution of Benches and allocation of specific cases to those Benches , can more smoothly be performed by the Chief Justice and discharge of such a function by the Collegium would be unworkable and also lead to many practical difficulties .
