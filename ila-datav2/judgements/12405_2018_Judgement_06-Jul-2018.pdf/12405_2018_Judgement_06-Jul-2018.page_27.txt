Such reforms in the administration of justice are not limited to the judicial aspects ( i.e. how the cases need to be decided , case management and court management , speedy disposal etc . ) but also include reforms on the administrative side of the legal system as well . Procedural reforms and implementation thereof is an integral part of the judicial reform . The ultimate purpose is to dispense justice , which is the highest and noblest virtue . Again , in this role , the ‘ Chief Justice ’ gets the authority and responsibility for the administration of the Court , which gives him the ultimate authority for determining the distribution of judicial work load . In Indian context , this power was given statutory recognition by Section 214(3 ) of the Government of India Act , 1935 which reads as under : “ ( 2 ) Rules made under this section may fix the minimum number of judges who are to sit for any purpose , so however that no case shall be decided by less than three judges : Provided that , if the Federal Legislature makes such provision as is mentioned in this chapter for enlarging the appellate jurisdiction of the court , the rules shall provide for the constitution of a special division of the court for the purpose of deciding all cases which would have been within the jurisdiction of the court even if its jurisdiction had not been so enlarged .
