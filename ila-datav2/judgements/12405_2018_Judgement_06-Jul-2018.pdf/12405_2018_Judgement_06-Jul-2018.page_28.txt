23 . 24 . ( 3 ) Subject to the provisions of any rules of court , the Chief Justice of India shall determine what judges are to constitute any division of the court and what judges are to sit for any purpose . ” Under the Constitution , the Supreme Court is given the authority to frame Rules for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the Court , including various subjects as enumerated in sub - Article ( 1 ) of Article 145 . Supreme Court Rules , 2013 which have been framed in exercise of such a power empowered the Chief Justice to constitute the Benches and list particular matters before such Benches . Similar powers are conferred upon the Chief Justice of the High Courts in the Rules framed by respective High Courts for regulating its procedure . At the same time , the power of the ‘ Chief Justice ’ does not extend to regulate the functioning of a particular Bench to decide cases assigned to him once the cases are allocated to that Bench . A Bench comprising of puisne Judges exercise its judicial function without interference from others , including the ‘ Chief Justice ’ , as it is supposed to act according to law . Therefore , when a particular matter is assigned to a particular Bench , that Bench acquires the complete dominion over the case .
