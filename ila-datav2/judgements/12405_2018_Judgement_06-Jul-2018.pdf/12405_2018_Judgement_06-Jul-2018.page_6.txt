( b ) Thus , although the Chief Justice is the Master of the Roll under the convention , the Constitution has departed from the conventional Scheme to confer power upon the supreme Court . ( c ) The expression ‘ Chief Justice ’ has been interpreted by a Constitution Bench of this Court in S.P. Gupta v.
