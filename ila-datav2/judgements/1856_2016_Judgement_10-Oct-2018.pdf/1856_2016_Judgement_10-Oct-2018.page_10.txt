23.11.2012 ( Objection Paper No.23C2 ) wherein the judgment dated 10.05.2012 of the civil court was mentioned and it was even averred that the said judgment was passed wrongly . It is thus clear that the appellants had knowledge about the judgment and decree in Suit No.591 of 1979 even on 23.11.2012 . While so , the appellantsdefendants have filed application with incorrect averments that they got knowledge about the judgment and decree only on 06.05.2013 at Tehsil Ghosi when constable of the Police Station gave them the information . The High Court rightly rejected the contention of the appellants that they came to know about the judgment dated 10.05.2012 in Suit No.591 of 1979 only on 06.05.2013 through a constable of the Police Station in Tehsil Ghosi , District Mau when he had gone there to Pairvi in another case . 18 . Itis also pertinent to note that in Suit No.591 of the year 1979 , the appellants have not filed the written statement in spite of ample Opportunities given and earlier the suit was decreed ex - parte against them on 16.04.1981 . The appellants filed appeal in CA No.395 of 1981 and it was dismissed for default and the same was restored on 14.11.1983 . By order dated 29.11.1985 , CA No.395 of 1981 was allowed and the ex - parte decree dated 16.04.1981 was set aside and the matter was remanded back for decision on merits afresh with condition of depositing cost of Rs.50/- . Of course , Writ 10
