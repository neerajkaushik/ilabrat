Petition(C ) No.19550 of 1985 was filed challenging the same ; the suit being of the year 1979 and earlier being set ex - parte and the matter having been remitted at the instance of the appellants , the appellants ought to have been vigilant in pursuing the matter . 19 . The order sheet and other materials placed on record clearly show that the appellants had full Knowledge about the proceedings of the Original Suit No.591 of 1979 and also about the disposal of the Writ Petition(C ) No.19550 of 1985 and the appellants have filed application for condonation of delay with incorrect facts . Both the First Appellate Court and the High Court recorded concurrent findings that the appellants have filed the application for condonation of delay with incorrect facts and were negligent in pursuing the matter and rightly refused to condone the delay . We do not find any perversity or infirmity in the impugned order warranting interference and the appeal is liable to be dismissed . 20 . Inthe result , the appeal is dismissed .
