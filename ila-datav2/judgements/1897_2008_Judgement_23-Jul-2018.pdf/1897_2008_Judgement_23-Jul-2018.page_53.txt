53 only Sections 41 and 51 of the 2003 Act contemplate prior approval of the Appropriate Commission before a licensee can engage in any other business other than that of a licensee under the 2003 Act , what is contemplated by the aforesaid provisions of the 2003 Act is some return or earning of revenue from such business . In the instant case , the “ other activities ” of the Corporation are not optional as contemplated under Sections 41/51 of the 2003 Act but are mandatorily cast by the statute i.e. Act of 1948 which , being in the nature of socially beneficial measures , per se , do not entail earning of any revenue so as to require maintenance of separate accounts . The allowance of recovery of cost incurred in connection with “ other activities ” of the Corporation from the common fund generated by tariff chargeable from the consumers / customers of electricity as contemplated by the provisions of the Act of 1948 , therefore , do not collide or is , in any manner , inconsistent with the provisions of the 2003 Act . We will , therefore , have no occasion to interfere with the findings recorded by the learned Appellate Tribunal on the above score .
