50 apportioned between the Corporation and the consumers as held by the CERC in the ratio of 40:60 or the entire fund should be allowed to be recovered by way of tariff from the consumers as held by the learned Appellate Tribunal . The reasoning of the learned Appellate Tribunal in coming to the aforesaid conclusion is as follows : “ D.3 AS a _ general rule , once the Commission , after prudence check , has agreed with the need for funding the Pension and Gratuity Contribution funds , DVC should have been allowed to recover entire amount from the consumers through the tariff . Asking DVC to contribute out of its own resources would tantamount to denying it the return on equity as assured in terms of Tariff Regulations . However , if we look at it from the point of view of the consumers , the consumers , particularly the industrial and commercial ones , have now no option to adjust their sale price to take into consideration the need for meeting the accumulated liability . It is , therefore , an accepted fact that due to postponing of the creation of such fund , the consumers were enjoying lesser tariff than the legitimate tariff otherwise applicable to them . ” 53 . A careful consideration of the reasoning adopted by the learned Appellate Tribunal would not disclose any such error so as to warrant interference of this Court . No error or fallacy , ex facie , is disclosed in the reasoning adopted so as to justify interference under Section 125 of the 2003 Act .
