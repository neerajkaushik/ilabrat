19 Section 114 of the Code of Civil Procedure ( “ CPC ” ) which , inter alia , postulates that “ any person considering himself aggrieved ” would have locus to file a review petition . Order XLVII of CPC restates the position that any person considering himself aggrieved can file a review petition . Be that as it may , the Supreme Court exercises review jurisdiction by virtue of Article 137 of the Constitution which predicates that the Supreme Court shall have the power to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it . Besides , the Supreme Court has framed Rules to govern review petitions . Notably , neither Order XLVII of CPC nor Order XLVII of the Supreme Court Rules limits the remedy of review only to the parties to the judgment under review . Therefore , we have no hesitation in enunciating that even a third party to the proceedings , if he considers himself an aggrieved person , may take recourse to the remedy of review petition . The quintessence is that the person should be aggrieved by the judgment and order passed by this Court in some respect .
