16 pressed into service by NTC . In paragraph 7 of the judgment , the argument canvassed on behalf of NTC has been noted as under : “ 7 , Shri Parag P. Tripathi , learned Additional Solicitor General , appearing for the appellant has submitted that the judgments and decrees of the courts below have to be set aside as none of the courts below has taken into consideration the effect of the provisions of the 1995 Act by virtue of which the textile undertaking stood absolutely vested in the Central Government and further vested in the appellant . As on the expiry of the lease of 99 years on 22 - 101990 , the 1947 Act was in force , the then tenant , Podar Mills became the statutory tenant . Such tenancy rights stood vested absolutely in the Central Government on the commencement of the 1995 Act by operation of law . The appellant stepped in the shoes of the Central Government merely as an agent , thus , the Central Government remained the tenant . The Central Government continued to be a tenant in the suit premises and thus , would be protected in terms of Section 3(1)(a ) of the 1999 Act being premises let out to the Government . The courts below failed to consider this vital legal issue . The suit filed by the respondents was not maintainable . The judgments and decrees of the courts below are liable to be set aside . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 18 . This Court , after considering the rival submissions , held that NTC had not specifically pleaded in the written statement that the tenancy stood vested absolutely in the Central Government and resultantly , no issue in that behalf was framed nor any argument was advanced before the Trial
