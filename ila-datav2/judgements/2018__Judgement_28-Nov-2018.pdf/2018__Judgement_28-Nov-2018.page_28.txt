28 28 . Reverting to the judgment under review , it is noticed that the provisions of the 1983 Act and 1995 Act have been generally adverted to while dealing with the plea taken by the appellant NTC that it was in possession of the suit property merely as an agent of the Central Government . However , the Court declined to entertain that plea of NTC as it was not so specifically pleaded in the written statement . The Court then concluded that the appellant NTC was neither the “ Government ” nor “ Government Department ” nor “ Agent ” of the Central Government in the context of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act , 1999 . That view has been taken in reference to the 1983 Act and the “ un - amended ” provisions of 1995 Act . Indeed , the review petitioners would argue that on a fair reading of the un - amended provisions contained in 1995 Act and juxtaposed with the provisions of 1983 Act , the inescapable conclusion is that the leasehold rights continued to vest in the Central Government . However , we are not inclined to countenance this argument .
