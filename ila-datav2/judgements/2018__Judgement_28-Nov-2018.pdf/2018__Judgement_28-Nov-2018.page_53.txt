53 Holdover tenant : A person who remains in possession of real property after a previous tenancy ( esp . one under a lease ) expires , thus giving rise to a tenancy at sufferance . Sometimes shortened to holdover . See tenancy at sufferance under TENANCY . [ Cases : Landlord and Tenant-119(2 ) . ] 41 . Indeed , if the matter in issue is to be decided dehors the provisions of the applicable Rent Act , then it is possible to say that the expression “ leasehold rights ” would be limited to a subsisting lease . However , in the present case , we are required to reckon the status of the Union of India and NTC qua the suit property in the context of the rights accrued in terms of the provision of the Rent Act of 1947 and 1999 , respectively . The expression “ leasehold rights ” in 1995 Act , obviously , must receive wider meaning so as to encompass “ tenancy rights ” flowing from the applicable Rent Act . For , the expression “ tenancy rights ” accruing under the Rent Act is analogous to and interchangeable with the expression “ leasehold rights ” . There is no reason to exclude the expression “ statutory right ” so enjoyed by the owners of the Textile Undertaking from the expression “ leasehold rights ” referred to in sub - section ( 3 ) , so long as it has not been so expressly excluded .
