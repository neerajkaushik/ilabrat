19 . The appellant opposed the conciliation proceedings contending that the offences were non - compoundable whereupon the case was again referred back to the High Court for decision on merits . 20 . By the impugned order dated 20 - 03 - 2006 , the High Court allowed the application under Section 482 Cr . P.C. observing that the complainant had , without assigning any reason , withdrawn the first complaint and launched prosecution by filing a fresh complaint ; that the complaint arose out of a commercial transaction ; and that the complainant would have to approach the Civil Court for recovering dues if at all arising out of commercial transaction . 21 . The short question in this appeal is whether the High Court should have quashed the criminal proceedings being Crime No.54 of 2005 on the grounds that the appellant had withdrawn an earlier complaint without assigning reasons ; the transactions being commercial in nature , the ingredients of an offence under the Sections referred to above were absent ; and that the remedy of the appellant lay in filing a civil suit .
