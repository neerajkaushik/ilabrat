for the High Court to enter into factual arena and decide whether the allegations were correct or whether the same were a counter - blast to any proceedings initiated by the respondents . 38 . In Jatinder Singh ( supra ) , this Court clearly held that if dismissal of the complaint was not on merit , but on default of the complainant , moving the Magistrate again with a second complaint on the same _ facts is maintainable . But if the dismissal of the complaint under Section 203 of the Code was on merits , the position could be different . 39 . The failure to mention the first complaint in the subsequent one is also inconsequential as held , in effect , in Jatinder Singh ( supra ) . Mentioning of reasons for withdrawal of an earlier complaint is also not a condition precedent for maintaining a second complaint . In our considered opinion , the High Court clearly erred in law in dismissing the complaint , which certainly disclosed an offence prima facie . At the cost of repetition , it is reiterated that it was not for the High Court to enter the factual arena and adjudicate the merits of the allegations . 16
