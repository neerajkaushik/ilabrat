22 . There is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code or any other statute which debars a complainant from making a second complaint on the same allegations , when the first complaint did not lead to conviction , acquittal or discharge . In Shiv Shankar Singh v. State of Bihar and Anr . ’ , this Court held : “ 18 . Thus , it is evident that the law does not prohibit filing or entertaining of the second complaint even on the same facts provided the earlier complaint has been decided on the basis of insufficient material or the order has been passed without understanding the nature of the complaint or the complete facts could not be placed before the court or where the complainant came to know certain facts after disposal of the first complaint which could have tilted the balance in his favour . However , the second complaint would not be maintainable wherein the earlier complaint has been disposed of on full consideration of the case of the complainant on merit . ” 23 . As held by this Court in Jatinder Singh and Others v. Ranjit Kaur ’ , it is only when a complaint is dismissed on merits after an inquiry , that a second complaint can not be made on the same facts . Maybe , as contended by the respondents , the first complaint was withdrawn without assigning any reason . However , that in itself is no ground to quash a second complaint . 1 ( 2012 ) 1 SCC 130 2 2001 ( 2 ) SCC 570
