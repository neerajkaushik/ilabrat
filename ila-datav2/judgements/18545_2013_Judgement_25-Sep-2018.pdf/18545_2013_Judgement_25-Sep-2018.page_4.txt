introspection and reform has been recognised and there has been a positive and constructive expression of interest shown by the Union of India in this regard . The present petition arose out of a concern shown by former Chief Justice R.C. Lahoti on four issues , namely , overcrowding in prisons ; unnatural deaths of prisoners ; gross inadequacy of staff ; and the available staff being untrained or inadequately trained . Ever since this petition has been pending disposal , despite several directions issued by this Court from time to time , no finality has yet been attached to the rights of prisoners . On the contrary , issues that require consideration have multiplied and new vistas have opened for consideration . 6 . With this preamble , before we actually pass agreed directions that have been accepted by the learned Attorney General , it is necessary to give a few background facts relating to the efforts made in the past on the issue of the rights of prisoners . Earlier efforts on the rights of prisoners 7 . The first effort relating to the rights of prisoners was made through the Report of the All India Committee on Jail Reforms , 1980 - 1983 , commonly known as the Mulla Committee . Some of the recommendations made by the Mulla Committee were accepted by the Government of India , while some were not . But what is more important is the discussion relating to the purpose of punishment and the changes that should be brought about W.P. ( C ) No . 406 of 2013 Page 4 of 14
