Employment , the State Governments and the UTAs to put in place and strengthen the registration machinery , both for the registration of establishments as well as registration of construction workers . This should be done within a specified time - frame to be decided by them , but at the earliest . 69 . Our second direction to the Ministry , the State Governments and UTAs in this regard is to establish and strengthen the machinery for the collection of cess . It is a matter of common knowledge that there is a tremendous amount of construction activity going on all over the country and there is no reason why establishments involved in the construction activity , both formal as well as non - formal , should not pay the cess , especially when they are utilizing the services of the construction workers . Similarly , there is no reason why the construction workers of these establishments should be denied their entitlements and benefits under the BOCW Act and other laws . As noted above , huge amounts are involved and we will not be surprised if the quarterly collection of Rs . 5000 crores is perhaps the minimum - the cess collected could be much , much more , if the registration machinery and the collection machinery are strengthened and work to their potential . 70 . As we have seen above , State Governments and UTAs have framed a W.P. ( C ) No.318 of 2006 etc . Page 47 of 57
