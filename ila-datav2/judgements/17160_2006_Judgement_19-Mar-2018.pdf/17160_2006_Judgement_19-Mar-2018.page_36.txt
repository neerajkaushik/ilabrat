scheme after another without giving any thought to the formulation of these schemes , monitoring their efficacy and supervising their implementation . The implementation of these schemes appears to be only on paper . ( c ) Other benefits : The affidavits of the Union of India advert to some statutory benefits . For example , it is stated that a large number of construction workers would be entitled to the benefit of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme , since most of the works undertaken through the scheme , barring a few relating to forestry , horticulture , etc . fall within the meaning of ‘ building or other construction work ’ as defined in Section 2(1)(d ) of the BOCW Act . Similarly , every establishment , falling within the purview of Section 1(4 ) of the BOCW Act , employing more than 20 workers would be covered by the provisions of the Employees ’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act , 1952 . Finally , any establishment covered by the provisions of Section 1(5 ) of the Employees ’ State Insurance Act , 1948 , and employing 10 or more workers is obliged to provide health benefits and other benefits under the said Act to the workers . It is submitted on affidavit by the Union of India that : if any establishment employs 20 or more building construction workers , it not only falls within the purview of the BOCW Act , but also falls within the purview of the Employees ’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act , 1952 W.P.
