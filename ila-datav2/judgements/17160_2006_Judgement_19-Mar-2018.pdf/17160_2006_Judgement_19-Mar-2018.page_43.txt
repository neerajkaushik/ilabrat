reflects a very sad state of affairs , and the loss already caused to them and other construction workers can not be remedied . The reason for this is that it is not known which construction worker is entitled to get how much in terms of money or what benefit and under which scheme . Some of these construction workers from the 1990s and even later , may perhaps have unfortunately passed away or might be untraceable or old enough to deserve a pension . The question therefore is : What should be done with the thousands of crores that have been collected for the benefit of construction workers but can not be utilized for their benefit ? Can the State Governments and the UTAs or the Welfare Boards unjustly benefit and fill their coffers at the expense of unknown and helpless construction workers , some of whom are women and some having small children ? These are questions for which we have not been provided any answers at all - it is entirely for the Government of India and Parliament to decide how to legally appropriate these thousands of crores of rupees and then utilize the amounts for the benefit of construction workers , at least for the future , assuming nothing can be done for the past . It is a mammoth task for which the powers that be must brace themselves , if they are serious in assisting people with multiple vulnerabilities . W.P. ( C ) No.318 of 2006 etc . Page 43 of 57
