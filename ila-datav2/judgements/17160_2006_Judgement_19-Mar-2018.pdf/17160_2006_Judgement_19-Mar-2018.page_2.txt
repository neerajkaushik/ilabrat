laws solemnly enacted by Parliament , namely , the Building and Other Construction Workers ( Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service ) Act , 1996 ( the BOCW Act ) and the Building and Other Construction Workers ’ Welfare Cess Act , 1996 ( the Cess Act ) . Directions given by this Court from time to time to implement the two laws have been flouted with impunity . What is equally tragic is that multiple directions issued even by the Government of India under Section 60 of the BOCW Act have been disregarded by State Governments and UTAs - and this is candidly admitted in a statement made by the learned Additional Solicitor General in this Court and also by the Union of India on affidavit . Hopefully , the gravity of the situation in the constitutional and federal context , the human rights and social justice context will be realized by someone , somewhere and at some time . 2 . We have been informed that under the Cess Act , more than Rs . 37,400 crores have been collected for the benefit of construction workers , but only about Rs . 9500 crores have been utilized ostensibly for their benefit . What is being done with the remaining about Rs . 28,000 crores ? Why is it that construction workers across the country are being denied the benefit of this enormous amount ? These are some questions that arise in this petition — are the answers blowing in the wind ? W.P. ( C ) No.318 of 2006 etc . Page 2 of 57
