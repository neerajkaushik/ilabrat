Discussion and directions 63 . There can be no doubt that the BOCW Act and its sister legislation , the Cess Act are social justice legislations . They were enacted keeping in mind the Directive Principles of State Policy , particularly Article 39 of the Constitution which requires the State to direct its policy to secure the health and strength of workers and Article 42 of the Constitution concerning just and humane conditions of work . In addition , Article 21 of the Constitution can not be forgotten . A life of dignity is a fundamental right given to all persons and that includes construction workers . It is in this background that the two welfare and beneficent legislations must be understood and appreciated . 64 . The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the BOCW Act refers to 8.5 million construction workers ( 85 lakhs ) in 1995 - 1996 . They were the vulnerable section of society who needed the support of the State for their safety , health and welfare . They have been consistently let down by the State and even directions given by this Court and by the Ministry of Labour and Employment has not brought about any substantive change . Governance is not about mouthing platitudes , or framing good looking schemes , but about action and it is quite clear to us that insofar as the rights of construction workers are concerned , that vulnerable section of society has been badly let W.P.
