the service to the workers is not required to be a condition precedent for the levy of the cess . The rendering of welfare services can reasonably be undertaken only after the cess is levied , collected and credited to the welfare fund . We also find no merit in other submission advanced on behalf of the appellants that there is a legal impediment in charging levy on the cost of construction incurred by the employer from a particular period on account of constitution of the Board from a particular date or for any other reason . This argument is fallacious . Such beneficial measures for the welfare of the workers are applicable even to the construction activity which may have commenced before coming into force of the BOCW Act and the Cess Act , if they are subsequently covered by the provisions of these Acts . There can be no legal obstacle in ignoring the construction cost incurred before the cess became leviable by distinguishing it from the cost of construction incurred later , from a date when the Board is available to render service to the building and other construction workers . The levy of cess in these facts and circumstances can not be faulted for any reason . The demand of cess in the given facts can not amount to retrospective application of the Cess Act . Hence the appeals must fail . ‚Äù 21 . Notwithstanding the law being absolutely clear and constitutionally valid , it was not being implemented in accordance with the intent of Parliament . Therefore , there was a need for the petitioner to move this Court and for this Court to take up the issues raised as matters relating to social justice and human rights . Positive directions issued by the Court 22 . Bearing in mind the welfare and beneficial intent behind the BOCW Act and the Cess Act and for their effective and meaningful implementation , this Court has issued a series of directions since May 2008 . This Court was W.P. ( C ) No.318 of 2006 etc . Page 14 of 57
