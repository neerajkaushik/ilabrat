Yet another significant aspect of the implementation of the BOCW Act that was neglected and brought to the notice of this Court related to the constitution of the State Building and Other Construction Workers ’ Welfare Board under the provisions of Section 18 of the BOCW Act . The Welfare Board is not an administrative body , but is a body corporate , having perpetual succession and a common seal and which may sue and be sued . The Welfare Board has a range of functions to perform and these are detailed in Section 22 of the BOCW Act . These functions include providing assistance to a beneficiary in case of an accident , providing pension to beneficiaries , sanctioning loans , providing financial assistance for the education of children of beneficiaries and so on .
