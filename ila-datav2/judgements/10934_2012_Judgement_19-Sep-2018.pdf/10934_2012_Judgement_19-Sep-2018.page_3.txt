GOVERNING LAW This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Indian Law . 19 . DISPUTES AND ARBIRATION Any dispute or difference arising under and or out of or in connection with and/or relating to this Agreement , which can not be settled amicably between the parties , shall be determined by arbitration and shall be governed by the law of India . Each party shall appoint one arbitrator with power to such arbitrators to appoint , if necessary , an umpire . The language for arbitration shall be English , and shall be governed by the Indian Law . ” 5 . Ona perusal of the aforesaid Clauses , there can be no trace of doubt that an arbitration clause exists and the same clearly stipulates that any dispute or difference arising under and/or out of or in connection with and/or relating to the Agreement unless amicably settled shall be determined by arbitration . The assertions in the petition clearly state that disputes have arisen and remain unsettled . In the obtaining factual matrix and keeping in view the existence of arbitration clause meant for determination of dispute by arbitration , we appoint Justice Gyan Sudha Misra , formerly a Judge of this Court , to act as the arbitrator to determine the dispute between the parties .
