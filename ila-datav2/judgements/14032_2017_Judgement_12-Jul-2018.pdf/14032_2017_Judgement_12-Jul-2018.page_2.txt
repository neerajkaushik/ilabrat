4 . Mr. Nishant R. Katneshwarkar , learned standing counsel appearing for the State , submits that as of now , there is no vacancy available . Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case , which we have referred to above , we are of the view that this is a fit case to invoke our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India , in the interest of justice and for doing complete justice . 5 . Accordingly , this appeal is disposed of with a direction to the respondent - State to accommodate the appellant in any one of the arising vacancies in Class IV in District Buldhana . 6 . We make it clear that there may not be any appointment in Class IV without first accommodating the appellant . We further make it clear that this Judgment is passed in the ’ peculiar facts ’ and circumstances of this case and the same may not be treated as a precedent . No costs . cee J.
