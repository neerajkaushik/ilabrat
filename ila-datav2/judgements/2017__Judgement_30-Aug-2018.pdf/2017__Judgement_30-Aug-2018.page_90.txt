90 State of origin to some other State for the purpose of seeking education , employment , etc . will be deemed to be a Scheduled Caste / Tribe of the State of his origin and will be entitled to derive benefits from the State of origin and not from the State to which he has migrated . 29 . My Conclusion for agreeing with the view taken in paras ( 30 ) and ( 32):- It is now settled law that a person belonging to Scheduled Caste / Scheduled Tribe in State ‘ A ’ can not claim the same status in another State ' B ' on the ground that he is declared as a Scheduled Caste / Scheduled Tribe in State ' A ’ . The expressions " in relation to that State or Union Territory " and " for the purpose of this Constitution " used in Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India are to be meaningfully interpreted . A given caste or tribe can be a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in relation to that State or Union Territory for which it is specified . Thus , the person notified as a Scheduled Caste in State ' A ' can not claim the same status in another State on the basis that he was declared Scheduled Caste in State ' A ’ . Article 16(4 ) has to yield to the Constitutional mandate of Articles 341 and 342 . Union Territories : 30 . Part VIII of the Constitution of India deals with Union Territories .
