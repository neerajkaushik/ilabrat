98 Pondicherry having adopted _ a_policy of the Central Government whereunder all Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes , irrespective of their State are eligible for posts which are reserved for SC / ST candidates , no legal infirmity can be ascribed to such a policy and the same_cannot_be held to be contrary to any provision of law . " ( Underlining added ) In my considered view , the above observation in Pushpa 's case is nota correct view . The judgment in Pushpa 's case is contrary to the views taken in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao 's case . The judgment in Pushpa 's case is contrary to the views taken in Marri Chandra Shekhar Rao 's case . Facts of Pushpa ’s case disclose that the Government of Pondicherry had throughout proceeded on the basis that being a Union Territory all orders regarding reservation for SC / ST in respect of post / services under the Central Government were applicable to post / services as under the Pondicherry administration . The decision in Pushpa ’s case therefore can not be taken to be an authoritative pronouncement . Clause ( 2 ) of Article 341 of the Constitution empowers Parliament alone by law to include or exclude from the lists of Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause ( 1 ) of Article 341 . No executive action or order or modification or variance of the same is possible and any such variance would be against the constitutional scheme .
