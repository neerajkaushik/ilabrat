The appellant - plaintiff claims that he is the owner of Plot no . 27 ( now bearing Municipal no . 1443 situated in Wazir Nagar , Gali No . 7 , Kotla Mubarakpur , New Delhi ) along with the adjoining land totally measuring 260 square yards . The respondents - defendants illegally trespassed into the above land and have raised construction without the consent and knowledge of the appellant . The said construction is unauthorised inasmuch as the same is raised without sanction from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi ( for short ‘ MCD ’ ) or any other competent authority . The respondents do not have any right to be in possession of the said piece of land and they have not handed over the possession of the plot in question to the appellant despite repeated requests and demands by the appellant . The respondents have also obtained electricity and water connections by misrepresenting the MCD . The respondents though have no ownership over the property in question , encroached upon the same . Per contra , it is the case of the respondent that the appellant is not the owner of the suit property as the same was purchased by the respondent from one Dharampal , s / o Haveli Ram as per the sale deed dated 15.8.1966 for a consideration of Rs.10,000/- .
