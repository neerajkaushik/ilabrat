is the requirement of 50 appearances per year in the block year ; for AORs , it is minimum of 20 filings or 50 appearances in a period of one year for two years and minimum 40 filings or 100 appearances in a period of 730 days . However , if the cut - off date starts from the year 2004 , this purpose may be lost in many cases , resulting in alloting the chambers to those who may be non - active as of today . There may be cases where a non - AOR or AOR may fulfil conditions of appearances / filing in first 730 days starting from the year 2004 i.e. during the year 2004 - 2005 and thereafter he may not have any appearances or filings , or such appearances / filings may be negligible . Still he / she would become entitled to allotment of chamber . This would bring in such advocates who may not be in active practice in recent past . Such a situation can not be countenanced . We , therefore , find rationale in the decision taken by the Judges ' Allotment Committee for fixing the block period from June 01 , 2011 to June 30 , 2016 as contained in the revised notice dated May 16 , 2018 viz . fixing the block period which is proximate to the notice for making application for the allotment . Therefore , starting of cut - off date from the year 2004 is unacceptable . 25 ) Since , sometime has elapsed when the block period was fixed by Writ Petition ( Civil ) No . 745 of 2018 & Ors .
