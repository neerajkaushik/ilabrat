of the justice delivery system at any Court . It isa matter of common knowledge that such Bar Associations are in existence , from the inception of the modern Court system itself and are active in their own sphere . The Supreme Court also has in place , the Supreme Court Bar Association and which is taking care of the interest of its members and also coordinates with the authorities of the Supreme Court for welfare of its Members and also for further improvements in the justice delivery system at the Supreme Court . XX XX XX Without prejudice to the above , it is most respectfully reiterated that after securing enrolment as an Advocate under the Advocates Act , 1961 - the Ld . Advocates , for consideration for being extended certain facilities at the respective Court premises , are made obliged to also obtain membership with the local Bar Association , which also provides an additional forum / mechanism ( besides and in addition to the Court authorities itself ) to facilitate and regulate the conduct / affairs of the Ld . Advocates practicing before any Court of law . It is most humbly submitted that contentions to the contrary raised in the present Writ Petition seeking to question the correctness and validity of the above - mentioned Rule obliging the Ld . Advocates to secure the Membership of SCBA for consideration for extending the facility of allotment of Chamber is entirely valid and legal . " 37 ) We , therefore , do not find any reason to interfere with the requirement of being a member of SCBA for submitting application for allotment of chambers . 38 ) Alternative submission of the petitioners is that if the rule is upheld , an opportunity should be given to those members of SCAORA , who have not become the members of SCBA so far , to Writ Petition ( Civil ) No . 745 of 2018 & Ors .
