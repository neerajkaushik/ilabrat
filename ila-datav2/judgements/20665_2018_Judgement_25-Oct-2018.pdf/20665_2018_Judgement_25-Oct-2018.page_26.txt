It is during this period the applicant shall have to satisfy the criteria and appearances or filing as indicated above . We are also not accepting the suggestion given in Para 5 of the Note that the allotment of chambers should be a continuous process . There has been a consistent practice in the past of inviting applications from time to time whenever lawyers ' chambers become available for allotment . It should be maintained as there is no reason to depart from the same . Otherwise , the purpose of fixing proximate block period shall also get defeated . At the same time , we also find that last such applications were invited in the year 2004 and considerable period has lapsed thereafter . Therefore , in order to ensure that such situation does not occur in future , we are of the opinion that Notice inviting such applications should be at least once in three years . Validity of Rule 3 of the Allotment Rules : As per this rule , the    membership of SCBA is essential to apply for allotment of Writ Petition ( Civil ) No . 745 of 2018 & Ors . Page 26 of 39
