Court to provide the facility of a chamber to an advocate it would really be a matter of discretion of the Principal Judge of the Court to decide to whom and to what extent that facility should be extended when the same is available ; and his only obligation would be to act in a fair and just manner and not arbitrarily . It may be proper for him to frame rules , appoint a committee and fix guidelines for the purpose of allotment of chambers ; but the obligation is no higher than to act in a reasonable manner . It would be for him to decide when , to whom , to what extent and on what terms and conditions he should allot chambers . ‚Äù 35 ) Having regard to the existence of Rule 4 in the Rules and Regulations of SCAORA itself , the entire edifice of the petitioners case stands demolished . No doubt , SCAORA has its significant position in this Court . However , we are concerned with the issue of allotment of chambers . The petitioners have submitted that members of SCAORA should be treated as sufficient eligibility for allotment of chambers . Yet , in order to become a member of SCAORA , as per Rule 4 of the Rules and Regulations of SCAORA itself , an advocate has to be the member of SCBA . Therefore , unless an advocate is an AOR and also a member of SCBA , he can not become the member of SCAORA . This requirement itself accepts the position that SCBA is an umbrella organisation and also recognises the vital role it plays . Thus , the argument based on Article 14 of the Constitution would be of no avail . Writ Petition ( Civil ) No . 745 of 2018 & Ors . Page 34 of 39
