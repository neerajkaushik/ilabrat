The review petitioners may be justified in pointing out that this Court committed an error apparent on the face of the record in observing that the appellant had never raised the issue before the courts below that the Central Government was the tenant and the appellant was holding the premises merely as an agent ; and that a vague plea was taken about the non - joinder of the parties - which plea was not even pursued before the Trial Court . Those errors , in our opinion , would not affect the final conclusion recorded by this Court in the judgment under review , considering the effect of the provisions as were applicable at the relevant time in the form of “ unamended ” Section 3 of the 1995 Act .

That view taken by this Court does not merit any review . Resultantly , it is not necessary to dilate on the decisions in S. Bagirathi Ammal Vs . Palani Roman
