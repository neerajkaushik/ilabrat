Having observed that Section 3 has been amended w.e.f . 1 * April , 1994 and upon giving full effect to the amendment , it must necessarily follow that the Central Government had acquired the status of protected or statutory tenant qua the suit property from that date and continue to remain so , and could be evicted only in the manner prescribed by the concerned rent legislation .
