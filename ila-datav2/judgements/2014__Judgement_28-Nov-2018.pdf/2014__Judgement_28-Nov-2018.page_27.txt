27 Report said that “ the section does not authorise the review of a decree which was right when it was made on the ground of the happening of some subsequent event ” . Counsel for the appellant submitted that when the High Court decided the matter , the High Court applied the law as it stood and a subsequent change of law could not be a ground for review . The appellant ’s contention is not acceptable in the present case for two principal reasons ; first , it is not a subsequent law . It is the law which all along was there from 1952 . The deeming provision is fully effective and operative as from May 25 , 1953 when the 1952 Act came into force . The result is that the court is to apply the legal provision as it always stood . It would , therefore , be error on the face of the record . The error would be that the law that was applied was not the law which is applicable . Secondly , Section 4 of the 1952 Act confers power on the court to apply the law notwithstanding any provision contained in the Code of Civil Procedure . Therefore the application though intituled an application for review was not so . The substance and not the form of the application will be decisive . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 27 . Applying the underlying principle and as jurisdictional issues have been raised which are essentially founded on the law enacted by the Parliament with retrospective effect containing a legal fiction and for doing complete justice to the parties , besides the power of review under Article 137 of the Constitution , it is open to this Court to exercise its plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution .
