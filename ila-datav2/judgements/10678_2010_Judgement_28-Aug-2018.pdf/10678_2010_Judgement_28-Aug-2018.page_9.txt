declarations have not been corroborated by the material witnesses . 11 . Taking stock of the facts and circumstances of the case , in our view , the High Court has rightly felt that the dying declaration in the case on hand did not inspire confidence so as to award conviction to the accused . In this state of things , the Court has to give benefit of doubt to the accused as it is not safe to sustain the conviction as implicit reliance can not be placed on the dying declaration under the peculiar circumstances of the case . 12 . For all the aforesaid reasons , we uphold the impugned order passed by the High Court . The appeal is accordingly dismissed being devoid of merit . SSS IL ATRESIA ACERS AT J. ( N.V.
