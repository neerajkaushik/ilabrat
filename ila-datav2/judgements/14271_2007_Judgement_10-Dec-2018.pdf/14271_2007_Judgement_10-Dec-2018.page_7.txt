10 . 11 . on record . The High Court observed that , the alleged suit property was not included in the book of endowments , moreover , the plaintiffs have been paying taxes in regard to the suit property in their name . Therefore , the defendants in the guise of a certificate can not claim the suit premises . Aggrieved , by the aforesaid order of the High Court decreeing the suit in favour of the respondents - plaintiffs , the appellant ( defendant no.4 ) has preferred the present appeal . Heard the learned counsels for both the parties . The counsel on behalf of the appellant ( defendant no.4 ) submitted that the High Court gravely erred in decreeing the suit in favour of the respondents- plaintiffs by merely relying on the entry in the book of endowments as to the boundaries . Further , the counsel averred that , the plaintiff no.1 manipulated the record showing himself to be the owner of the suit property , whereas he was a pujari acting as a custodian of the temple . Lastly , the counsel rested his argument by stating that since the certificate issued by the Deputy Commissioner in O.A. No . 70 of 1985 is still valid , the plaintiffs are not entitled to a decree restraining the defendants from dispossessing them from Schedule ‘ A ’ property and recovering Schedule ‘ B ’ property . 7
