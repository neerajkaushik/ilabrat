21 . 22 . documentary and oral evidence to prove their claim . But , the High Court without appreciating the aforesaid evidences and claims made by the appellant ( defendant no.4 ) , decreed the suit in favour of the respondents - plaintiffs by solely relying on the entry made in the book of endowments department stating the boundaries of the temple . The aforesaid judgment of the High Court is untenable in law as it is based on erroneous appreciation of evidence . In light of the aforesaid observations we set aside the judgment of the High Court decreeing the suit in favour of respondentsplaintiffs in the absence of any evidence to substantiate their claim . Resultantly , we restore the order passed by the Subordinate Judge , Jagtial in O.S 69 of 1987 . The appeal is allowed , however , without any order as to costs . Pending applications , if any , shall also stand disposed of . ssh ARASRATE UANNITR AR aE ARIE aS J. ( Mohan M. Shantanagoudar ) NEw DELHI , DECEMBER 10 , 2018 . 12
