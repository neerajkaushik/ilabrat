( iii ) on a specific contract assignment to a foreign Government , unless , after having been transferred to India , he has resumed the charge of the post in India and served for a period of not less than one year . ( 2 ) The notice of voluntary retirement given under sub - rule ( 1 ) shall require acceptance by the appointing authority : Provided that where the appointing authority does not refuse to grant the permission for retirement before the expiry of the period specified in the said notice , the retirement shall become effective from the date of expiry of the said period . ‚Äù aR eR aR 33 . It is clear from sub - rule ( 2 ) of the Rule that the appointing authority is required to accept the notice of voluntary retirement given under sub - rule ( 1 ) .
