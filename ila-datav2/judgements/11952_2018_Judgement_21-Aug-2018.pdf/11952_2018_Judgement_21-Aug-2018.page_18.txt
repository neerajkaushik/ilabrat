18 communicated . We are not able to read the meaning of the word " withhold " as indicating that in the absence of a communication it must be understood as the permission having been withheld . ” The rule which came up for consideration in B.J. Shelat ( supra ) was the Rule 161 of Bombay Civil Services Rules , 1959 . The Rule 161(1 ) ( aa ) provides that appointing authority may retire a Government servant in public interest by giving him a notice of not less than three months or three months ’ pay and allowances in lieu thereof . Rule 161(2)(ii ) did not employ the word public interest when the Government servant seeks voluntary retirement . This has been added to the Rule applicable in the State of Uttar Pradesh . Neither there is any provision in the aforesaid rules that require to pass an order to decide an application by a Government servant seeking voluntary retirement that too considering the public interest . Under the rules , it was open to the appointing authority to withhold the permission to retire a Government servant who is under suspension or against whom the departmental enquiry was pending or contemplated . The rules considered by this Court in B.J. Shelat ( supra ) were different and did not contain the provision like Explanation as incorporated in the Fundamental Rule 56 as applicable in the State of Uttar Pradesh . In that context , the discussion has been made and can not be applied to a rule differently couched in U.P.
