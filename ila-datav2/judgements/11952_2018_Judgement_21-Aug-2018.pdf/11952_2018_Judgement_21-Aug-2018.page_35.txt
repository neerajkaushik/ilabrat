The fundamental duties itself are enshrined under Article 51(A ) which require observance . The right under Article 19(1)(g ) is subject to the interest of the general public and once service has been joined , the right can only be exercised as per rules and not otherwise . Such conditions of service made in public interest can not be said to be illegal or arbitrary or taking away the right of liberty . The provisions of the rule in question can not be said to be against the Constitutional provisions . In case of voluntary retirement , gratuity , pensions , and other dues etc . are payable to the employee in accordance with rules and when there is a requirement of the services of an employee , the appointing authority may exercise its right not to accept the prayer for voluntary retirement . In case all the doctors are permitted to retire , in that situation , there would be a chaos and no doctor would be left in the Government hospitals , which would be against the concept of the welfare state and injurious to public interest . In the case of voluntary retirement , there is a provision in Rule 56 that a Government servant may be extended benefit of an additional period of five years then an actual period of service rendered by him there is the corresponding obligation to serve in dire need .
