30 25 . In our considered opinion , under Rule 56 as applicable in the State of Uttar Pradesh , notice of voluntary retirement does not come into effect automatically on the expiry of the three months period . Under the rule in question , the appointing authority has to accept the notice for voluntary retirement or it can be refused on permissible grounds . 26 . In our opinion , the Rule 56(c ) does not fall in the category where there is an absolute right on the employee to seek voluntary retirement . In view of the aforesaid dictum and what is held by this Court , we find that the prayer made to make a reference to a larger Bench , in case this Court does not follow the earlier decision is entirely devoid of merit as on the basis of what has been held by this Court in the earlier decisions , we have arrived at the conclusion . This Court has authoritatively laid down the law umpteen number of time . 27 . Reliance has also been placed on behalf of respondents on the decision in Mahant Dhanmir vs. Madan Mohan , ( 1987 ) Supp SCC 528 , in which this Court observed that law should not be unsettled unless there are compelling reasons . There is no dispute that the said proposition has already been held . There is no question of law unsettling the law but is of its application , which unfortunately appears as against the interests of the respondents in view of language employed in the rule in question . An attempt in vain has been made
