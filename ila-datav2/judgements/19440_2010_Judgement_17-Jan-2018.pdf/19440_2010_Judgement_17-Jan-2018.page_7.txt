7 10 . One more important discrepancy in the prosecution case that gives rise to suspicion of truthfulness of police officers is that , as deposed by Anjani Kumar ( PW 12 ) the entire seized case property together with six sample parcels was deposited by him with Gandhi Ram ( PW 6 ) . Whereas Dabe Ram , SHO ( PW4 ) says that Anjani Kumar ( PW12 ) produced three bags and three sample parcels before him at 8.30 pm . On the other hand , the material on record proves the same wrong as at the relevant time , PW12 was present at Sadar Police Station , Mandi and sent special report to Superintendent of Police ( Ext . PW 11 / A ) . 11 . It also appears from the record that in order to satisfy the requirement of Section 55 of N.D.P.S. Act , the case property was accordingly tampered by the police . It is also relevant to mention here that in the prescribed form , the place of seizure was mentioned as Nagwain and not Panarsa Bridge and the name of only one accused i.e. Santosh Kumar was shown from whom the contraband was said to have been seized while he was carrying three gunny bags . As rightly observed by the High Court , it appears that the name of other accused was added afterwards to justify the fact that one person could not have carried three bags of contraband at a time .
