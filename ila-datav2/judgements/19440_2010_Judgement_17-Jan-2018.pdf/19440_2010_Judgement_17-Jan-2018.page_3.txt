4 . Aggrieved by the order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court , the accused filed appeals before the High Court and the High Court after analyzing the evidence allowed their appeals and set aside the conviction . Dissatisfied with the acquittal order passed by the High Court , the State is in appeal before us . 5 . We have heard learned counsel appearing for the appellant â€” State of Himachal Pradesh and the learned counsel appearing for the respondents as well , and carefully gone through the material on record . 6 . It is submitted before us by the learned counsel for the State that while dealing with the appeals of the accused , the High Court has given greater importance to trivial discrepancies in the prosecution case . Ignoring the cogent evidence advanced by official witnesses , the High Court simply held that there were material contradictions in their depositions and without assigning any plausible reason allowed the appeals of the accused and thereby committed an error of law .
