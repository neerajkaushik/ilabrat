3 ( ii ) Second , the petitioner though named as an accused in the FIR was not given an opportunity of hearing nor was made a party in the public interest litigation in which the impugned judgment has been passed . Resultantly , the judgment under appeal is a nullity and liable to be set aside only on this score . ( iii ) Third , no special circumstances have been noted by the High Court in the impugned judgment for transferring the investigation to CBI . The High Court has not even bothered to examine the efficacy of the status report regarding the investigation done by the Vigilance Commission . In other words , there was no tangible ground for directing investigation of the crime in question by the CBI . ( iv ) Lastly , it is contended that the writ petition filed as public interest litigation was politically motivated having been filed by a member of the Legislative Assembly in the State of Tamil Nadu . 3 . To buttress the above - mentioned grounds of challenge , reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of State of Punjab Vs . Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar and Ors . ! * ( 2011 ) 14 SCC 770
