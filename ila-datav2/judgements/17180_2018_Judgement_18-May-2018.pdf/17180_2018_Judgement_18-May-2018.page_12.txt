12 the investigation already done by the Vigilance Commission has been considered , also does not commend us . As noted earlier , the High Court in the impugned judgment has exhaustively analysed all aspects of the matter as can be discerned from paragraphs 84 to 87 , 91 to 97 , 100 to 107 ; and again in paragraphs 141 - 144 which have been extracted hitherto . In our opinion , in the peculiar facts of the present case , the High Court has justly transferred the investigation to CBI after due consideration of all the relevant aspects , which approach is consistent with the settled legal position expounded in the decisions adverted to in the impugned judgment , including the decision in Subrata Chattoraj Vs . Union of India and Ors . , > which predicates that transfer of investigation to CBI does not depend on the inadequacy of inquiry / investigation carried out by the State police . We agree with the High Court that the facts of the present case and the nature of crime being investigated warrants CBI investigation . Â° ( 2014 ) 8 SCC 768
