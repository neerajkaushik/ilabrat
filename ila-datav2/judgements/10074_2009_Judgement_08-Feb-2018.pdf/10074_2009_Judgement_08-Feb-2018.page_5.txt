5 entitling them to raise their respective arguments in the second appeal , without determining as to who is the actual legal representative of the deceased under Order 22 Rule 5 CPC . 5 . The main contention of the appellants is that the High Court has committed a grave error of law by allowing both the impleadment applications preferred by the rival contenders staking claim to be the genuine legal representatives of the deceased , without determining the question under the prescribed provisions of law as to who is the legal representative of the deceased appellant . The High Court â€™s order is not in consonance with the provisions of Order 22 Rule 5 of CPC and it is unjust that instead of deciding the paramount question , the High Court had simply passed the order entitling both the contenders to raise their respective arguments in the subject matter of Suit . The order of the High Court is perverse , not in the interest of justice and contrary to the settled principles of law . 6 . The counsel on behalf of the respondent has argued in support of the order passed by the High Court and submitted that the High Court has rightly allowed both the applications by giving opportunity to contest the appeal .
