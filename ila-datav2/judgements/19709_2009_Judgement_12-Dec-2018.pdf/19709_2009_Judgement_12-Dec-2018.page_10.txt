17 . The consideration of socio - economic factors is tied up with another important issue ( which need not necessarily or always be taken into consideration for sentencing purposes , but could be relevant in a given case ) and that is whether the convict has had adequate legal representation . Several accused persons belonging to the weaker sections of society can not afford defence counsel and they are obliged to turn to the National Legal Services Authority , the State Legal Services Authority or the District Legal Services Committee for legal representation . While these authorities provide the best legal assistance possible at their command , it sometimes falls short of expectations resulting in the conviction of an accused and , depending upon the facts of the case and the sentencing process followed , a sentence of death follows . 18 . That the poor are more often than not at the receiving end in access to justice and access to the remedies available is evident from a fairly recent report prepared by the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee * which acknowledges , through Project Sahyog , enormous delays in attending to cases of the poor and the needy . Quality legal aid to the disadvantaged and weaker sections of society is an area that requires great and urgent attention and we hope that a vigorous beginning is made in this direction in the new year . 4 Website of the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee â€” www.sclsc.nic.in R.P.
