‘ the Rules were meant only for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act and they could not take away what was conferred by the Act or whittle down its effect . ” 29 ) In the present case , the aforesaid view gets strengthened from the manner in which the Legislature itself acted . Realising that Section 67 , dealing with valuation of taxable services , does not include reimbursable expenses for providing such service , the Legislature amended by Finance Act , 2015 with effect from May 14 , 2015 , whereby Clause ( a ) which deals with ‘ consideration ’ is suitably amended to include reimbursable expenditure or cost incurred by the service provider and charged , in the course of providing or agreeing to provide a taxable service . Thus , only with effect from May 14 , 2015 , by virtue of provisions of Section 67 itself , such reimbursable expenditure or cost would also form part of valuation of taxable services for charging service tax . Though , it was not argued by the learned counsel for the Department that Section 67 is a declaratory provision , nor could it be argued so , as we find that this is a substantive change brought about with the amendment to Section 67 and , therefore , has to be prospective in nature . On this aspect of the matter , we may usefully refer to the Constitution Bench judgment in the case of Civil Appeal No . 2013 of 2014 with Ors . Page 41 of 44
