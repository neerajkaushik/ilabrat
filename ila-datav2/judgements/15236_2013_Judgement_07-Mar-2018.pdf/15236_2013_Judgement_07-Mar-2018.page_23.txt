India [ AIR 1962 SC 1281 : 1962 Supp ( 3 ) SCR 436 , 451 ] . In that case , the Central Government was authorised by an Ordinance to levy and collect as a cess on coal and coke despatched from collieries in British India a duty of excise at a specified rate . Rule 3 made under the Ordinance empowered the Government to impose a duty of excise on coal and coke when such coal and coke was despatched by rail from the collieries of the coke plants , and the duty was to be collected by the Railway Administration by means of a surcharge on freight either from the consignor or consignee . It was contended by the assessee that the excise duty could not legally be levied on the consignee who had nothing to do with the manufacture or production of coal . The Court remarked : “ The argument confuses the incidence of taxation with the machinery provided for the collection thereof , ” and reference was made to / n re the Central Provinces and Berar Act 14 of 1938[AIR 1939 FC 1 , 6 : 1939 FCR 18 ] , Province of Madras v. Boddu Paidanna and Sons [ 1942 FCR 90 , 101 : AIR 1942 FC 33 ] and Governor - General in Council v. Province of Madras [ 1945 FCR 179 : AIR 1945 FC 98 ] . This Court then summarised the law as follows : “ ... Excise duty is primarily a duty on the production or manufacture of goods produced or manufactured within the country . It is an indirect duty which the manufacturer or producer passes on to the ultimate consumer , that is , its ultimate incidence will always be on the consumer . Therefore , subject always to the legislative competence of the taxing authority , the said tax can be levied at a convenient stage so long as the character of the impost , that is , it is a duty on the manufacture or production , is not lost . The method of collection does not affect the essence of the duty , but only relates to the machinery of collection for administrative convenience . ” Other cases followed where the nature of excise duty was reaffirmed in the terms set out earlier , and Civil Appeal No . 2013 of 2014 with Ors .
