recipient of service to act as his pure agent to incur expenditure or costs in the course of providing taxable service ; e neither intends to hold nor holds any title to the goods or services so procured or provided as pure agent of the recipient of service ; e does not use such goods or services so procured ; and e receives only the actual amount incurred to procure such goods or services . Explanation 2 : For the removal of doubts it is clarified that the value of the taxable service is the total amount of consideration consisting of all components of the taxable service and it is immaterial that the details of individual components of the total consideration is indicated separately in the invoice . Illustration 1 : X contracts with Y , a real estate agent to sell his house and thereupon Y gives an advertisement in television . Y billed X including charges for Television advertisement and paid service tax on the total consideration billed . In such a case , consideration for the service provided is what X pays to Y. Y does not act as an agent behalf of X when obtaining the television advertisement even if the cost of television advertisement is mentioned separately in the invoice issued by X. Advertising service is an input service for the estate agent in order to enable or facilitate him to perform his services as an estate agent . Illustration 2 : In the course of providing a taxable service , a service provider incurs costs such as traveling expenses , postage , telephone , etc . , and may indicate these items separately on the invoice issued to the recipient of service . In such a case , the service provider is not acting as an agent of the recipient of service but procures such inputs or input service on his own account for providing the taxable service .
