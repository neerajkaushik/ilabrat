reference may be made to / n re Bill to Amend Section 20 of the Sea Customs Act , 1878 and Section 3 of the Central Excises And Salt Act , 1944 [ AIR 1963 SC 1760 : ( 1964 ) 3 SCR 787 ] ; Union of India v. Delhi Cloth & General Mills [ AIR 1963 SC 791 : 1963 Supp ( 1 ) SCR 586 ] ; Guruswamy & Co. v. State of Mysore [ AIR 1967 SC 1512 : ( 1967 ) 1 SCR 548 ] and South Bihar Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Union of India [ AIR 1968 SC 922 : ( 1968 ) 3 SCR 21 ] . XXX XXX XXX 17 . A contention was raised for some of the assessees , that the measure was to be found by reading Section 3 with Section 4 , thus drawing the ingredients of Section 3 into the exercise . We are unable to agree . We are concerned with Section 3(1 ) , and we find nothing there which clothes the provision with a dual character , a charging provision as well as a provision defining the measure of the charge .

We shall discuss that presently . As to the third proposition , that the exclusion of post - manufacturing expenses and post - manufacturing profit is necessarily involved in the first principle does not inevitably follow . The exclusion of post - manufacturing expenses and postmanufacturing profits is a matter pertaining to the ascertainment of the “ value ” of the excisable article , and not to the nature of the excise duty , and as we Civil Appeal No . 2013 of 2014 with Ors .
