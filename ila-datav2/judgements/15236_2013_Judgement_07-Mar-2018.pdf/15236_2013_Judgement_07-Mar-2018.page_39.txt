In other words , valuation of taxable services for charging service tax , the authorities are to find what is the gross amount charged for providing ‘ such ’ taxable services . As a fortiori , any other amount which is calculated not for providing such taxable service can not a part of that valuation as that amount is not calculated for providing such ‘ taxable service ’ . That according to us is the plain meaning which is to be attached to Section 67 ( unamended , i.e. , prior to May 01 , 2006 ) or after its amendment , with effect from , May 01 , 2006 . Once this interpretation is to be given to Section 67 , it hardly needs to be emphasised that Rule 5 of the Rules went much beyond the mandate of Section 67 . We , therefore , find that High Court was right in interpreting Sections 66 and 67 to say that in the valuation of taxable service , the value of taxable service shall be the gross amount charged by the service provider ‘ for such service ’ and the valuation of tax service can not be anything more or less than the consideration paid as quid pro qua for rendering such a service . This position did not change even in the amended Section 67 which was inserted on May 01 , 2006 . Sub - section ( 4 ) of Section Civil Appeal No . 2013 of 2014 with Ors . Page 39 of 44
