26 ) 27 ) 28 ) 67 empowers the rule making authority to lay down the manner in which value of taxable service is to be determined . However , Section 67(4 ) is expressly made subject to the provisions of subsection ( 1 ) . Mandate of sub - section ( 1 ) of Section 67 is manifest , as noted above , viz . , the service tax is to be paid only on the services actually provided by the service provider . It is trite that rules can not go beyond the statute . In Babaji Kondaji Garad , this rule was enunciated in the following manner : “ Now if there is any conflict between a statute and the subordinate legislation , it does not require elaborate reasoning to firmly state that the statute prevails over subordinate legislation and the byelaw , if not in conformity with the statute in order to give effect to the statutory provision the Rule or bye - law has to be ignored . The _ statutory provision ahs precedence and must be complied with . ” The aforesaid principle is reiterated in Chenniappa Mudaliar holding that a rule which comes in conflict with the main enactment has to give way to the provisions of the Act . It is also well established principle that Rules are framed for achieving the purpose behind the provisions of the Act , as held in Taj Mahal Hotel : Civil Appeal No . 2013 of 2014 with Ors .
