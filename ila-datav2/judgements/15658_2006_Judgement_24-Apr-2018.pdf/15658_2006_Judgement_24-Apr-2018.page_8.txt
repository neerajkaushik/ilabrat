High Court was right in rejecting the claim of the Appellant and no interference is sought for by this Court in the matter . Discussion : 7 ) In the instant case , it is a matter of dispute that second notice issued on 20.11.2000 is not valid and competent since the first notice issued by the same Assessing Officer dated 09.09.1999 under Section 158BC was valid and _ the assessment ought to be made in pursuance of that notice and , therefore , the Assessing Officer has no authority to issue the second notice . 8) In this view of the matter , it is pertinent to mention Section 158BD of the IT Act which reads as under : “ 158BD . Undisclosed income of any other person.- Where the Assessing Officer is satisfied that any undisclosed income belongs to any person , other than the person with respect to whom search was made under section 132 or whose books of account or other documents or any assets were requisitioned under section 132A then , the books of account , other documents or assets seized or requisitioned shall be handed over to the Assessing Officer having jurisdiction over such other person and that Assessing Officer shall proceed under section 158BC against such other person and the provisions of this Chapter shall apply accordingly . ” It can be seen that notice under Section 158BD can be issued to a person with respect to whom search was not conducted
