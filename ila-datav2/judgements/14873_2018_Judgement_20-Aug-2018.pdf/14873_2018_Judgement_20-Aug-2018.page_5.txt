of 100 % of profits and gains for five assessment years commencing with the initial assessment year and , thereafter , 25 % of profits and gains . Total exemption , thus , is for a period of 10 years , namely , @100 % for 1 * five years and @ 25 % for remaining five years . In these cases , all the assessees started claiming exemption @ 100 % on profits and gains and availed it for a period of five years . During this period these assessees carried out “ substantial expansion ” and they claimed that , on that basis , they should be allowed exemption from profits and gains for another five years @ 100 % instead of 25 % from 6 " to 10 " year as well . Interestingly , they admit that the total period during which they are entitled to exemption would not exceed 10 years , as per the mandate of sub - section ( 6 ) . In this backdrop , the question is as to whether the assessees can again start claiming 100 % exemption for the next five years from profits and gains after availing the same for first five years on the ground that they have now carried out substantial expansion . The High Court has answered the question in affirmative and for this reason , it is the department which has come up to this Court challenging the said decision by filing these appeals . 3 . Though , the aforesaid question of law is identical in all the aforesaid cases and arises in the same fact situation mentioned Civil Appeal No . 7208 OF 2018 & Ors . Page 5 of 17
