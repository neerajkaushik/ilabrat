profits and gains are from industrial undertakings or enterprises engaged in infrastructure development etc . Even this availment started at a time when Section 80-IC was not even on the statute book . As mentioned above , Section 80-IC was inserted by the Finance Act , 2003 with effect from April 01 , 2004 . The assessees in those cases had started claiming and were allowed deductions from the Assessment Years 1998 - 99 and 1999 - 2000 under Section 80-IA and from the Assessment Year 2000 - 01 to Assessment Year 2005 - 06 under Section 80-IB of the Act . The deduction was , thus , claimed by the assessees in those appeals under the new provision i.e. Section 80-IC on fulfilling conditions contained in sub - section ( 2 ) of Section 80-IC for the first time for the Assessment Year 2006 - 07 . Thus , insofar as those cases are concerned , the initial Assessment Year under Section 80-IC started only from the Assessment Year 2006 - 07 . In contrast , position here is altogether different . These assessees have availed deduction under Section 80-IC alone . _ Initially , they claimed the deduction on the ground that they had set up their units in the State of Himachal Pradesh and after availing the deduction @ 100 % they want continuation of this rate of 100 % for the next 5 years also under the same provision on the ground that they have made substantial expansion .
