22 . once the assessees had started claiming deduction under Section 80-IC and the initial Assessment Year has commenced within the aforesaid period of 10 years , there can not be another initial Assessment Year thereby allowing 100 % deduction for the next 5 years also when sub - section ( 3 ) , in no uncertain terms , provides for deduction @ 25 % only for the next 5 years . It may be asserted again that the assessees accept the legal position that they can not claim deduction of more than 10 years in all under Section 80-IC . In view of the aforesaid discussion , we hold that after availing deduction for a period of 5 years @ 100 % of such profits and gains from the ‘ units ’ , the assessees would be entitled to deduction for remaining 5 Assessment Years @ 25 % ( or 30 % where the assessee is a company ) , as the case may be , and not @ 100 % . The question of law is , thus , answered in favour of the Revenue thereby allowing all these appeals . No order as to costs . sesssuessueesseessuesssesssessseessnesseesass J. ( A.K.
