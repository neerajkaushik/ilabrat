setting aside of the Appellate Order passed under Section 127 of the Act by the Appellate Authority rightly remanded the case to the Assessing Authority for making provisional assessment under Section 126 of the Act and then to take recourse under Section 127 of the Act for filing appeal , if need arises . We do not find any reason to disturb these directions which , in our opinion , are in conformity with the scheme of the Act . 13 ) So far as the applicability of the provisions of the new Electricity Act , 2003 to the case at hand is concerned , though some doubts were raised about its applicability but , in our opinion , it has no substance . In our opinion , the Act 2003 does apply to the facts of this case because the Act 2003 came into force on 10.06.2003 whereas the inspection of the Meter installed in respondent No.2 's factory premises was made by the sleuths of the Board on 02.08.2003 .
