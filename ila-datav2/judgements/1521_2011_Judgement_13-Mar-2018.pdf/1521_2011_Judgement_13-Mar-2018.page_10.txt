Rathore , not only acted totally arbitrarily on every step of the process of recruitment but , acted beyond his powers and jurisdiction while making the appointment . For the view we have taken that these appointments were made by an authority not competent to make such appointments , we do not consider it necessary to go into the other aspects of the controversy that one the appointees did not possess the requisite qualifications or that the currency of the sanction of the posts had expired . 18 . It is clear from the discussions in the preceding paragraphs that these appointments have been made in a totally irregular manner by an authority not competent to make such appointments . The appointment letters have been rightly cancelled and orders of cancellation do not call for any interference by this Tribunal . The applicants have miserably failed to establish any case in their favour . We dismiss these O.A. as totally devoid of merits . No order as to costs . ” 8 . Feeling aggrieved , the respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur , being D.B. Civil Writ Petition No.4235 of 2002 .
