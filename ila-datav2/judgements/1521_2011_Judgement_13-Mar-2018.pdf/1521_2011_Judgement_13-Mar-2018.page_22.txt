High Court of Kerala15 it was stated : ( SCC p.323 , para45 ) “ Principles of natural justice , however , can not be stretched too far . Their application may be subject to the provisions of a statute or statutory rule . ” ( emphasis supplied ) In the present case , the appointment letter was admittedly issued without the approval of the competent authority . 22 . In Dhirender Singh & Ors . Vs . State of Haryana & Ors.16 , termination of the appellant therein albeit without notice , was not interfered with by the Court as admittedly the same was not approved by the competent authority . The underlying principle will apply proprio vigore to the present case , as the letter of appointment has been issued by an officer who had no authority to do so and also because it was issued without waiting 15 ( 2004 ) 6 SCC 311 16 ( 1997 ) 2 SCC 712
