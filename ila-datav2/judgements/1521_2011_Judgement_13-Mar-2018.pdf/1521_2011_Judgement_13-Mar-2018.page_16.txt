16 the lack of approval of competent authority , can be no basis to whittle down the indefeasible right enured to him . Further , deprivation of opportunity of hearing before passing the termination order was fatal as the said order entailed civil consequences to him . The respondent prays for dismissal of the appeal . 14 . We have heard the learned counsels for appellants Mr. A.K. Panda , Senior Advocate , Mrs. C.K. Sucharita , Mr. Shailender Saini , Mr. Raj Bahadur and Mr. D.S. Mahra , and Dr. Manish Singhvi , Mr. Shailja Nanda Mishra , Mr. Satyendra Kumar , Mr. Yuvraj Simant and Mr. Irshad Ahmad , learned counsels for respondent . 15 . Reverting to the subject office order , we are in agreement with the stand taken by the appellant that the same is a simpliciter termination and is no reflection on the conduct of the respondent . It merely explicates that his appointment was illegal having been made by the then Director Incharge H.S. Rathore , Agriculture Officer and without prior approval of the competent authority . No more and no less .
