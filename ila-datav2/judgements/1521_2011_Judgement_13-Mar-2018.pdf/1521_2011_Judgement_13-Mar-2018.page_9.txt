9 reasons best known to him , he did not wait for this approval and went ahead and offered appointments to these applicants . This raise a serious doubt about the motive behind the haste on the part of Shri Rathore , in appointing these applicants . The plea now taken on his behalf that such approval was not required has no basis at all . This is more so , when the rules clearly provide that an officer looking after the current charge should not have exercised statutory powers of appointments . 14 . These appointments are vitiated on other grounds also . The fact that all the three applicants are related to Shri Rathore , can not be a mere co - incidence and reflects on the intention behind making these appointments . The ways the selection committee has been constituted by including even Group - C members , is indicative of the irregular practice knowingly adopted by Shri Rathore while making these appointments . ‚Äù ( emphasis supplied ) 7 . The Tribunal then adverted to the legal position that any appointment made de hors the statutory rules has no validity and that those who come by the back door have to return by the same back door and can not claim protection of principles of natural justice . For that , the Tribunal relied on the exposition of this Court in the case of Union of India & Ors . Vs . M. Bhaskaran ' , State of U.P. & Ors . Vs . U.P. State Law Officers Association & Ors . ? and Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan & 1 ( 1995 ) Suppl . 4 SCC 100 2 ( 1994 ) 2 SCC 204
