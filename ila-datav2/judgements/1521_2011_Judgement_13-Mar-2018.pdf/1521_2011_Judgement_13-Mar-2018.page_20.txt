In a case of this nature , where the facts are admitted , the principles of natural justice were not required to be complied with , particularly when the same would result in futility . It is true that where appointments had been made by a competent authority or at least some steps have been taken in that behalf , the principles of natural justice are required to be complied with , in view of the decision of this Court in Murugayya Udayar? ° . ” ( emphasis supplied ) 21 .
