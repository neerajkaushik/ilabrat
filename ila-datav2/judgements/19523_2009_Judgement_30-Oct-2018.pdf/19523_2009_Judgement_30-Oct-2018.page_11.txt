11 India , ( 2009 ) 7 SCC 561 , wherein it has been held that nonfloating of tenders or holding of auction by itself is not sufficient to hold that the exercise of power was arbitrary . It would be useful to reproduce the following observations from Netai Bag ( supra ) , which were also relied upon by the Court in Natural Resources Allocation , In Re ( supra ) to highlight that the ultimate test is only that of fairness of the decision - making process and compliance with Article 14 of the Constitution : “ 19 . ... There can not be any dispute with the proposition that generally when any State land is intended to be transferred or the State largesse decided to be conferred , resort should be had to public auction or transfer by way of inviting tenders from the people . That would be a sure method of guaranteeing compliance with the mandate of Article 14 of the Constitution . Nonfloating of tenders or not holding of public auction would not in all cases be deemed to be the result of the exercise of the executive power in an arbitrary manner . Making an exception to the general rule could be justified by the State executive , if challenged in appropriate proceedings . The constitutional courts can not be expected to presume the alleged irregularities , illegalities or unconstitutionality nor can the courts substitute their opinion for the bona fide opinion of the State executive . The courts are not concerned with the ultimate decision but only with the fairness of the decision - making process . ”
