16 that there was no discussion about the plight of the students in the correspondence between the Appellant - Academy and the Government . However , a mere lack of explicit statements to that effect does not imply that the action was not motivated by welfare considerations , inasmuch as the displacement and uprooting of several hundreds of students from their school was the obvious underlying concern in the representation made by the Appellant and the order passed by the State Government . It would be appropriate at this stage to quote the following observation made by this court in Shrilekha Vidyarathi vs. State of U.P. , ( 1991 ) 1 SCC 212 : “ 36 . The meaning and true import of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely stated or defined . The question , whether an impugned act is arbitrary or not , is ultimately to be answered on the facts and in the circumstances of a given case . An obvious test to apply is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned act and if so , does it satisfy the test of reasonableness . Where a mode is prescribed for doing an act and there is no impediment in following that procedure , performance of the act otherwise and in a manner which does not disclose any discernible principle which is reasonable , may itself attract the vice of arbitrariness . ”    ( emphasis supplied )
