The conduct of the appellant in absconding for approximately three months from the date of the occurrence , till he was taken into custody , was contrary to normal human behavior and belies his claim to innocence . It is not possible to accept the plea of any burn injuries on his hands three months later . The deceased died a homicidal death inside the matrimonial home . In the circumstances noticed hereinbefore , undoubtedly the appellant owed an explanation under    Section 106 of the Evidence Act , 1872 with regard to how the deceased had met a homicidal death inside the house . He failed to discharge the onus completely . The aforesaid , in our opinion , are sufficient to uphold the conviction of the appellant . 7 . Since an argument has been made with regard to three inconsistent dying declarations , we consider it only proper to deal with them also . The first dying    declaration , Exh.10 was recorded by a police officer at the hospital . It speaks of an accidental fire . Though it bears a seal of a medical officer below the certification of fitness , it is not signed by anyone .
