there is no eye witness to the occurrence . There were three dying declarations at variance with each other . Conviction has been erroneously based on the third dying declaration merely because it was made in presence of the Special Judicial Magistrate . Reliance in support of the submission was placed on State of Rajasthan v. Shravan Ram & Another , AIR 2013 SC 1890 . In the alternative it was submitted that the deceased may have died on account of accidental burns while cooking or brewing tea . The appellant may have    assaulted her under some grave provocation with regard to some occurrence inside the house to which no one else may have been privy . The appellant had also suffered burn injuries on his left hand while    attempting to save the deceased . The deceased was taken to the hospital by the appellant which is further proof of his innocence . The conviction under Section 302 IPC therefore deserves to be altered to one under Section 304-II IPC , if not acquittal . 3 . Learned counsel for the State opposing the appeal
