12 of the prosecutrix ( PW-4 ) must have been appreciated in the light of the background of the case ; more so , the prosecutrix ( PW-4 ) was reluctant to go back to the house of her aunt and complained the act of sexual intercourse committed by the respondent - accused to her teachers , Pooja Mahajan ( PW-1 ) and Ritubala ( PW-2 ) . The High Court has not appreciated the evidence of the prosecutrix ( PW-4 ) in the light of the well - settled principles and erred in reversing the conviction of the respondent - accused to the acquittal . The impugned judgment of the High Court is not sustainable and is liable to be set aside . Since at the time of incident the victim was at her tender age , we do not find any reason to show ’ sympathy towards ’ the respondent -accused . ( 22 ) In the result , the impugned judgment and order of the High Court is set aside and this appeal is allowed . The judgment of the Trial Court is restored confirming conviction of the respondent under Section 376 I.P.C. and the sentence of imprisonment of ten years . ( 23 ) The respondent - accused is to surrender to custody within a period of four weeks from today to serve the remaining sentence failing which he shall be taken to custody .
