The High Court held that the evidence of the prosecutrix ( PW-4 ) does not inspire the confidence of the court to sustain the conviction and the respondent accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt and on those findings the High Court has reversed the judgment of the Trial Court and set aside the conviction and sentence of the imprisonment imposed upon respondent -accused . ( 7 ) Despite service of notice , the respondent has not entered appearance . Accordingly Mrs. Manjeet Chawla , Advocate , has been nominated by the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee as amicus to contest the appeal on behalf of the respondent -accused . ( 8) We have heard Ms. Bihu Sharma , learned counsel appearing for the appellant - State and Mrs. Manjeet Chawla , learned amicus . We have carefully perused the impugned judgment , the evidence of the witnesses and materials on record . ( 9 ) The High Court has given the benefit of doubt to the respondent - accused mainly on two grounds : ( i ) Evidence of the prosecutrix ( PW-4 ) does not inspire confidence ; and ( ii ) the medical evidence of Dr. Neerja Gupta ( PW-6 ) Dr. Pooja Gupta ( PW-7 ) is not conclusive to hold that the prosecutrix ( PW-4 ) was subjected to sexual intercourse .
