79 . We are of the view that cases under the Atrocities Act also fall in exceptional category where preliminary inquiry must be held . Such inquiry must be time - bound and should not exceed seven days in view of directions in Lalita Kumari ( supra ) . 80 . Even if preliminary inquiry is held and case is registered , arrest is not a must as we have already noted . In Lalita Kumari ( supra ) it was observed : “ 107 . While registration of FIR is mandatory , arrest of the accused immediately on registration of FIR is not at all mandatory . In fact , registration of FIR and arrest of an accused person are two entirely different concepts under the law , and there are several safeguards available against arrest . Moreover , it is also pertinent to mention that an accused person also has a right to apply for “ anticipatory bail ” under the provisions of Section 438 of the Code if the conditions mentioned therein are satisfied . Thus , in appropriate cases , he can avoid the arrest under that provision by obtaining an order from the court . ” 81 . Accordingly , we direct that in absence of any other independent offence calling for arrest , in respect of offences under the Atrocities Act , no arrest may be effected , if an accused person is a public servant , without written permission of the appointing authority and if such a person is not a public servant , 86
