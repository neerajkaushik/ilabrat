According to the Report of the National Police Commission , when the power of arrest is grossly abused and clearly violates the personal liberty of the people , as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution , then the courts need to take serious notice of it . When conviction rate is admittedly less than 10 % , then the police should be Slow in arresting the accused . The courts considering the bail application should try to maintain fine balance between the societal interest vis - a - vis personal liberty while adhering to the fundamental principle of criminal Jurisprudence that the accused is presumed to be innocent till he is found guilty by the competent court . 87 . The complaint filed against the accused needs to be thoroughly examined including the aspect whether the complainant has filed a false or frivolous complaint on earlier occasion . The court should also examine the fact whether there is any family dispute between the accused and the complainant and the complainant must be clearly told that if the complaint is found to be false or frivolous , then strict action will be taken against him in accordance with law . If the connivance between the complainant and the investigating officer is established then action be taken against the investigating officer in accordance with law . 48
