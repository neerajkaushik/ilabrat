impugned section or Act , the Court will take that view of the matter and limit its application accordingly , in preference to the view which would = make it unconstitutional on another view of the interpretation of the words in question . In that case , the Court had to choose between a definition of the expression “ Prize Competitions ” as limited to those competitions which were of a gambling character and those which were not . The Court chose the former interpretation which made the rest of the provisions of the Act , Prize Competitions Act ( 42 of 1955 ) , with particular reference to Sections 4 and 5 of the Act and Rules 11 and 12 framed thereunder , valid . The Court held that the penalty attached only to those competitions which involved the element of gambling and those competitions in which success depended to a substantial degree on skill were held to be out of the purview of the Act . The ratio decidendi in that case , in our opinion , applied to the case in hand insofar as we propose to limit its operation only to such activities as come _ within the ambit of the observations of the Federal Court , that is to say , activities involving incitement to violence ’ or intention or tendency to create public disorder or cause disturbance of public peace . ” 58 . In the present context , wisdom of legislature in creating an offence can not be questioned but individual justice is a judicial function depending on facts . As a policy , anticipatory bail may be excluded but exclusion can not be intended to apply where a patently malafide version is put forward . Courts have inherent jurisdiction to do justice and this jurisdiction can not be intended to be excluded . Thus , exclusion of Court ’s jurisdiction is not to be read as absolute . 66
