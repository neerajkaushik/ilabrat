implemented One of the functions of the superior judiciary in India is to examine the competence and validity of legislation , both in point of legislative competence as well as its consistency with the Fundamental Rights .

The power extends to examining the validity of even an amendment to the Constitution , for now it has been repeatedly held that no _ constitutional amendment can be sustained which [ violates the basic structure of the Constitution .

Union of India [ 1981]1SCR206 ] and recently in S. P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India [ ( 1987)ILLJ/128SC ] .
