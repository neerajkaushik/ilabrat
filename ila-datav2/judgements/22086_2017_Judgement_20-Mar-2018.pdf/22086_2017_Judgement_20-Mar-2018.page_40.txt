side is the social need to check a crime , on the other there is social need for protection of liberty , oppression and abuse by the police and the other law enforcing agencies . This Court noted the 3 Report of the National Police Commission to the effect that power of arrest was one of the chief sources of corruption of police . 60 % of arrests were unnecessary or unjustified . The arrest could be unjustified only in grave offences to inspire the confidence of the victim , to check the accused from committing further crime and to prevent him from absconding . The National Police Commission recommended that the police officer making arrest should record reasons . This Court observed that no arrest can be made merely because it is lawful to do so . The exercise of power must be for a valid purpose . Except in heinous offences arrest must be avoided . This requirement was read into Article 21 ‚Äù . In Arnesh Kumar versus State of Bihar * , this Court observed that arrest brings humiliation , curtails freedom and casts scars forever . It is considered a tool for harassment and oppression . The drastic power is to be exercised with caution . Power of arrest is a lucrative source of corruption . Referring to 42 Para 21 43 ( 2014 ) 8 SCC 273 40
