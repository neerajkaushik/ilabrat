We approve the view taken and approach of the Gujarat High Court in Pankaj D Suthar ( supra ) and Dr. N.T. Desai ( supra ) and clarify the judgments of this Court in Balothia ( supra ) and Manju Devi ( supra ) ; In view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest in cases under the Atrocities Act , arrest of a public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority and of a non - public servant after approval by the S.S.P. which may be granted in appropriate cases if considered necessary for reasons recorded . Such reasons must be scrutinized by the Magistrate for permitting further detention . 88
