Secondly if the Accused under the POA Act surrenders with prior notice to the Public Prosecutor , then his bail Application should be considered on the same day and if not the regular bail , then at the least interim bail should be granted in the interest of justice . This requirement may be read into Section 18 of the POA Act . ” 21 . In support of the submission that courts have acknowledged the misuse of law , reliance has also been placed on the following Judgments : ( i ) Judgment of the Madras High Court in Jones versus State ™ wherein the High Court observed : “ This Court recently has brought to light the misuse of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes ( Prevention of Atrocities ) Act , 1989 against people of other community . This is another example of misuse of the Act . The purpose of bringing SC & ST Act is to put down the atrocities committed on the members of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes . The law enforcing authorities must bear in mind that it can not be misused to settle other disputes between the parties , which is alien to the provisions contemplated under the Act . An Act enacted for laudable purpose can also become unreasonable , when it is exercised overzealously by the enforcing authorities for extraneous reasons .
