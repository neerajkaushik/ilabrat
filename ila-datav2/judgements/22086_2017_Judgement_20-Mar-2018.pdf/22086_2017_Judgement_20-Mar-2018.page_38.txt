“ 62 . Until the decision was rendered in Maneka Gandhi ( supra ) , Article 21 was viewed by this Court as rarely embodying the Diceyian concept of rule of law that no one can be deprived of his personal liberty by an executive action unsupported by law . If there was a law which provided some sort of a procedure it was enough to deprive a person of his life or personal liberty . In this connection , if we refer to the example given by Justice S.R. Das in his judgment in A.K. Gopalan ( supra ) that if the law provided the Bishop of Rochester ‘ be boiled in oil ' it would be valid under Article 21 . But after the decision in Maneka Gandhi ( supra ) which marks a watershed in the development of constitutional law in our country , this Court , for the first time , took the view that Article 21 affords protection not only against the executive action but also against the legislation which deprives a person of his life and personal liberty unless the law for deprivation is reasonable , just and fair . and it was held that the concept of reasonableness runs like a golden thread through the entire fabric of the Constitution and it is not enough for the law to provide some semblance of a procedure . The procedure for depriving a person of his life and personal liberty must be eminently just , reasonable and fair and if challenged before the Court it is for the Court to determine whether such procedure is reasonable , just and fair and if the Court finds that it is not so , the Court will strike down the same . ” 35 .
