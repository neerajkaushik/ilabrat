citizen must be read consistent with the concept of fairness and reasonableness . 57 . A Constitution Bench of this Court in Kedar Nath versus State of Bihar ’ ® observed : “ 26 . It is also well settled that in interpreting an enactment the Court should have regard not merely to the literal meaning of the words used , but also take into consideration the antecedent history of the legislation , its purpose and the mischief it seeks to suppress [ vide ( 1 ) Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. State of Bihar[1955 2 SCR 603 ] and ( 2 ) R.M.D. Chamarbaugwala v. Union of India[1957 SCR 930 ] . Viewed in that light , we have no hesitation in so construing the provisions of the ’ sections impugned in these cases as to limit their application to acts involving intention or tendency to create disorder , or disturbance of law and order or incitement to violence . 27 . We may also consider the legal position , as it should emerge , assuming that the main Section 124-A is capable of being construed in the literal sense in which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has construed it in the cases referred to above . On that assumption , is it not open to this Court to construe the section in such a way as to avoid the alleged unconstitutionality by limiting the application of the section in the way in which the Federal Court intended to apply it ? In our opinion , there are decisions of this Court which amply justify our taking that view of the legal position . This Court , in the case of RMD . Chamarbaugwalla v. Union of India has examined in detail the several decisions of this Court , as also of the courts in America and Australia . After examining those decisions , this Court came to the conclusion that if the impugned provisions of a law come within the constitutional powers of the legislature by adopting one view of the words of the 56 AIR 1962 SC 955 : 1962 Supp ( 2 ) SCR 769 65
