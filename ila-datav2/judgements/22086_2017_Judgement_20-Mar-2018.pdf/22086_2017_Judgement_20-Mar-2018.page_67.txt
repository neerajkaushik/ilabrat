59 . There can be no dispute with the proposition that mere unilateral allegation by any individual belonging to any caste , when such allegation is clearly motivated and false , can not be treated as enough to deprive a person of his liberty without an independent scrutiny . Thus , exclusion of provision for anticipatory bail can not possibly , by any reasonable interpretation , be treated as applicable when no case is made out or allegations are patently false or motivated . If this interpretation is not taken , it may be difficult for public servants to discharge their bona fide functions and , in given cases , they can be black mailed with the threat of a false case being registered under the Atrocities Act , without any protection of law . This can not be the scenario in a civilized society . Similarly , even a non public servant can be black mailed to surrender his civil rights . This is not the intention of law . Such law can not stand judicial scrutiny . It will fall foul of guaranteed fundamental rights of fair and reasonable procedure being followed if a person is deprived of life and liberty . Thus , literal interpretation can not be preferred in the present situation . 67
