It was submitted that in the context of the Atrocities Act , in the absence of tangible material to support a version , to prevent exercise of arbitrary power of arrest , a preliminary enquiry may be made mandatory . Reasons should be required to be recorded that information was credible and arrest was necessary . In the case of public servant , approval of disciplinary authority should be obtained and in other cases approval of Superintendent of Police should be necessary . While granting such permission , based on a preliminary enquiry , the authority granting permission should be satisfied about credibility of the information and also about need for arrest . If an arrest is effected , while granting remand , the Magistrate must pass a speaking order as to correctness or otherwise of the reasons for which arrest is effected . These requirements will enforce right of concerned citizens under Articles 14 and 21 without in any manner affecting genuine objects of the Act . 15 . Learned amicus further submitted that Section 18 of the Atrocities Act , which excludes Section 438 Cr . P.C. , violates constitutional mandate under Articles 14 and 21 and is ultra vires 13
