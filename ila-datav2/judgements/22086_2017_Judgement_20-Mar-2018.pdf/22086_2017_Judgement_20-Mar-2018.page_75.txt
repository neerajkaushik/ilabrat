“ 33 . Presumption of innocence is a human right as envisaged under Article 14(2 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights . It , however , can not per se be equated with the fundamental right and liberty adumbrated in Article 21 of the Constitution of India . It , having regard to the extent thereof , would not militate against other statutory provisions ( which , of course , must be read in the light of the constitutional guarantees as adumbrated in Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India ) . XXXX XXXX XXXX 35 . A right to be presumed innocent , subject to the establishment of certain foundational facts and burden of proof , to a certain extent , can be placed on an accused . It must be construed having regard to the _ other international conventions and having regard to the fact that it has been held to be constitutional . Thus , a statute may be constitutional but a prosecution thereunder may not be held to be one . Indisputably , civil liberties and rights of citizens must be upheld . XXXX XXXX XXXX 43 . The issue of reverse burden vis - a - vis the human rights regime must also be noticed . The approach of the common law is that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove a person guilty . Indisputably , this common law principle was subject to parliamentary legislation to the contrary . The concern now shown worldwide is that Parliaments had frequently been making inroads on the basic presumption of innocence . Unfortunately , unlike other countries no systematic study has been made in India as to how many offences are triable in the court where the legal burden is on the accused . In the United Kingdom it is stated that about 40 % of the offences triable in the Crown Court appear to violate the presumption .
