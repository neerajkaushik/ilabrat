such situations . If a person is able to show that , prima facie , he has not committed any atrocity against a member of SC and ST and that the allegation was mala fide and prima facie false and that prima facie no case was made out , we do not see any justification for applying Section 18 in such cases . Consideration in the mind of this Court in Balothia ( supra ) is that the perpetrators of atrocities should not be granted anticipatory bail so that they may not terrorise the victims . Consistent with this view , it can certainly be said that innocent persons against whom there was no prima facie case or patently false case can not be subjected to the same treatment as the persons who are prima facie perpetrators of the crime . 54 . In view of decisions in Vilas Pandurang Pawar ( supra ) and Shakuntla Devi ( supra ) , \earned ASG has rightly stated that there is no absolute bar to grant anticipatory bail if no prima facie case is made out inspite of validity of Section 18 of the Atrocities Act being upheld . 63
