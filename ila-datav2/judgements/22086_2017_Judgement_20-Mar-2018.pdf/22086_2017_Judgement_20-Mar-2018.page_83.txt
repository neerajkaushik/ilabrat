star for interpretation , incorporates the values of liberty , equality and fraternity . 76 . We are satisfied , in the light of statistics already referred as well as cited decisions and observations of the Standing Committee of Parliament that there is need to safeguard innocent citizens against false implication and unnecessary arrest for which there is no sanction under the law which is against the constitutional guarantee and law of arrest laid down by this Court . 77 . We are conscious that normal rule is to register FIR if any information discloses commission of a cognizable offence . There are however , exceptions to this rule . In Lalita Kumari versus State of U.P. ® , it was observed : “ 115 . Although , we , in unequivocal terms , hold that Section 154 of the Code postulates the mandatory registration of FIRS on receipt of all cognizable offences , yet , there may be instances where preliminary inquiry may be required owing to the change in genesis and novelty of crimes with the passage of time . One such instance is in the case of allegations relating to medical negligence on the part of doctors . It will be unfair and inequitable to prosecute a medical professional only on the basis of the allegations in the complaint . 63 ( 2014 ) 2 SCC 1 83
