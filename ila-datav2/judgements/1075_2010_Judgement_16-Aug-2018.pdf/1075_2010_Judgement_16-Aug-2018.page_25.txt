25 . In view of the conflicting opinions expressed by different two Judge Benches of this Court , the importance of a fair investigation from the point of view of an accused as a guaranteed constitutional right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India , it is considered necessary that the law in this regard be laid down with certainty . To leave the matter for being determined on the individual facts of a case , may not only lead to a possible abuse of powers , but more importantly will leave the police , the accused , the lawyer and the courts in a state of uncertainty and confusion which has to be avoided . It is therefore held that a fair investigation , which is but the very foundation of fair trial , necessarily postulates that the informant and the investigator must not be the same person . Justice must not only be done , but must appear to be done also . Any possibility of bias or a predetermined conclusion has to be _ excluded . This requirement is all the more imperative in laws carrying a reverse burden of proof . 25
