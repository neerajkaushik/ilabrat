Court as a court of plenary jurisdiction being a court of record . ” 15 ) Insofar as Shri Naphade ’s arguments that the Act is a self - contained Code , Section 5 of which interdicts a review or recall application , suffice it to state that having held that there is no arbitration agreement pursuant to the order dated 27.06.2017 , the Act will not apply . 16 ) This being the case , the impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court is set aside . Shri Naphade urges us to continue the order dated 23.06.2017 for a period of four weeks from today so that he may approach the appropriate forum . We continue the said order for a period of four weeks from today . The appeal is disposed of accordingly . veces teseevtetenseeseeseees i. ( R.F. NARIMAN ) boca ee eee seevueeeuuueeeuueeeees J.
