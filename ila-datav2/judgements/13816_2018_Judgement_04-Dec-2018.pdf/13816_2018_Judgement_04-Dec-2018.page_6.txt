Clause 22 , no arbitration is provided for and that these are only in - house procedures . He went on to state that it is always inherent in a High Court , being a court of record , to recall its own orders , and has cited certain judgments together with the High Court ( Original Side ) Rules . According to him , the appeal under Section 37 itself was not maintainable and for all these reasons , the impugned order should be set aside . 9 ) On the other hand , Shri Shekhar Naphade , learned senior counsel argued on behalf of the respondent , stating that the Arbitration Act is a selfcontained Code , and , this being so , it is not possible to look outside the four corners of the Act to find a review power . This may apply even to Article 215 of the Constitution of India . He argued that Clause 13 and Clause 22 are clearly arbitration clauses inasmuch as a dispute has to be referred for decision to a Committee and thereafter to an Appellate Committee , after which , the decision rendered by the Appellate Committee is final and binding . According to Shri Naphade , the correct course could only have been to apply to Justice V.M. Kanade ( retired ) under Section 16 of the Act on whether an arbitration clause does or does not exist . He added that since the Code of Civil Procedure ( in short ‘ the Code ’ ) will not apply , therefore , there is no question of inherent power contained in Section 151 of the Code applying either .
