ordinary rules of procedure , applicable thereto and an appeal lies if authorised by such rules , notwithstanding that the legal right claimed arises under a special statute which does not , in terms confer a right of appeal . ” Again in Secretary of State for India v. Chellikani Rama Rao , ( 1916 ) I.L.R. 39 Mad . 617 , when dealing with the case under the Madras Forest Act their Lordships observed as follows : “ It was contended on behalf of the appellant that all further proceedings in Courts in India or by way of appeal were incompetent , these being excluded by the terms of the statute just quoted . In their Lordships ’ opinion this objection is not well - founded . Their view is that when proceedings of this character reach the District Court , that Court is appealed to as one of the ordinary Courts of the country , with regard to whose procedure , orders , and decrees the ordinary rules of the Civil Procedure Code apply . ” Though the facts of the cases laying down the above rule were not exactly similar to the facts of the present case , the principle enunciated therein is one of general application and has an apposite application to the facts and circumstances of the present case . Section 76 of the Trade Marks Act confers a right of appeal to the High Court and says nothing more about it . That being so , the High Court being seized as such of the appellate jurisdiction conferred by section 76it has to exercise that jurisdiction in the same manner as it exercises its other appellate jurisdiction and when such jurisdiction is exercised by a single Judge , his judgment becomes subject to appeal under Clause 15 of the Letters Patent there being nothing to the contrary in the Trade Marks Act . ” 10
