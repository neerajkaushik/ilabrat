objection to the same . As has been stated in the recall application and the affidavit of the Commissioner , Mr. Agashe was not empowered to take any decision regarding appointment of an Arbitrator . This being the undisputed position before the Court , it is clear that an oral agreement between the parties de hors Clause 13 and Clause 22 could not have been arrived at . We must also remind ourselves that this agreement was arrived at during the course of hearing of a Section 9 petition . In the present case , nobody has applied under Section 11 to appoint an Arbitrator in accordance with either Clause 13 or Clause 22 . 11 ) Insofar as the High Courts ’ jurisdiction to recall its own order is concerned , High Courts are courts of record , set up under Article 215 of the Constitution of India . Article 215 of the Constitution of India reads as under : “ Article 215 . High Courts to be courts of record . — Every High Court shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself . ” It is clear that these constitutional courts , being courts of record , the jurisdiction to recall their own orders is inherent by virtue of the fact that they are superior courts of record . This has been recognized in several of our judgments .
