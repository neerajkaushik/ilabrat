30 therefore , it could not affect the earlier notifications . Thereafter , this Court in Para 160 of the judgment held as follows : 38 . “ 160 . The types of reservation under Section 17-A and their scope have been considered by this Court in Indian Metals and Ferro Alloys Ltd. in paras 45 and 46 ( pp . 136 - 39 ) of the Report . I am in respectful agreement with that view . However , it was argued that Section 17-A(2 ) requires prior approval of the Central Government before reservation of any area by the State Government for the public sector undertaking . The argument is founded on an incorrect reading of Section 17-A(2 ) . This provision does not use the expression , “ prior approval ” which has been used in Section 11 .

These words in Section 17-A(2 ) can not be equated with prior approval of the Central Government . According to me , the approval contemplated in Section 17-A may be obtained by the State Government before the exercise of power of reservation or after exercise of such power . The approval by the Central Government contemplated in Section 17-A(2 ) may be express or implied . In a case such as the present one where the Central Government has relied upon the 2006 Notification while rejecting the appellants ’ application for grant of mining lease , it necessarily implies that the Central Government has approved reservation made by the State Government in the 2006 Notification otherwise it would not have acted on the same . In any case , the Central Government has not disapproved reservation made by the State Government in the 2006 Notification . ” In State of Kerala and Ors . v.
