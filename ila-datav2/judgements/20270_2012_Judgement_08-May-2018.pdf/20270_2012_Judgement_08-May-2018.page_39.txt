39 also economic factors , the policy of the Government and all such other factors which are relevant to decide the issue whether the land should be reserved for exploitation only by State Government Undertakings ; ( iii ) Section 11(1 ) and Section 17A(2 ) of the Act have no connection with each other . Section 11(1 ) of the Act deals with preference to be given to RP holder and PL holder while considering their case for grant of PL and ML respectively . This has nothing to do with reservation of land under Section 17A(2 ) of the Act . The only connection , if it can be called that , is that if a land is held under a PL or ML , then action under Section 17A(2 ) of the Act can not even be initiated ; ( iv ) In view of the discussion held above , we feel that the Central Government was justified in rejecting the request of the State of Karnataka in reserving the land in question . 47 . Before parting with the case , we may note that arguments were addressed before us on the effect of the amendments made in 2015 to the MMDR Act especially with regard to Section 10A and Section 10B. We are not dealing with these issues , as decision on them is not necessary to decide the present case .
