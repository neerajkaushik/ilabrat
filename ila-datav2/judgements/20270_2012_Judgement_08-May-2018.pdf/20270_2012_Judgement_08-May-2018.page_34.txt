34 deciding whether reservation should be made or not . The NMP , 2008 being a policy of the country , can definitely be taken into consideration while considering such a request . 41 . We may note that the policy of the Government can sometimes be binding on the Government if the principles of promissory estoppel or legitimate expectation come into play . We may make it clear that in this case neither the principle of promissory estoppel nor the principle of legitimate expectation is attracted . We are only making reference to these principles to emphasize that a policy of a Government is an important document . It can not be brushed aside . The Central Government , while considering the request of the State Government , can take into consideration various factors which may include economic factors , the factors reflecting the image of the country internationally to the global world community and also other factors of national security etc .. These are just illustrative and each case has to be decided on its own facts . Therefore , we are not in agreement with the Karnataka High Court that only those factors can be taken into consideration , which flow from the Act or the Rules .
