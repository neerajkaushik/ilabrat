21 Regulation ) Act ’ w.e.f . 18.12.1999 . By the same Act , in Section 17 of the Act , the words ‘ reconnaissance ’ and ‘ reconnaissance permit ’ were introduced w.e.f . 18.12.1999 . Prior to that , there was no concept of reconnaissance . Under the provisions of the Act , prior to the introduction of Section 17A , there was no statutory provision which empowered the State Government to reserve any land . However , under the Mineral Concession Rules , 1960 , ( hereinafter referred to as the ‘ Rules ’ ) there was a provision in Rule 58 , empowering the State Government to reserve such lands . After Section 17A was introduced on 10.02.1987 , Rule 58 was omitted on 13.04.1988 . We are pointing out these facts because some of the judgments cited , being prior to introduction of Section 17A , have to be read in the context of Rule 58 of the Rules . 28 . In Amritlal Nathubhai Shah and Others v. Union Government of India and Another ° , this Court held that the State being the owner of the land , was entitled to reserve the land and , therefore , was justified in rejecting the applications of the private parties . This judgment was delivered in the context of Rule 58 of the s ( 1976 ) 4 SCC 108
