32 . “ 46 . Before leaving this point , we may only refer to the position after 1986 . Central Act 37 of 1986 inserted sub - section ( 2 ) which empowers the State Government to reserve areas for exploitation in the public sector . This provision differs from that in Rule 58 in some important respects — ( i ) the reservation requires the approval of the C.G. ; ( ii ) the reservation can only be of areas not actually held under a PL or ML ; ( iii ) the reservation can only be for exploitation by a government company or a public sector corporation ( owned or controlled by the S.G. or C.G. ) but not for exploitation by the government as such . Obviously , Section 17-A ( 2 ) and Rule 58 could not stand together as Section 17-A empowers the S.G. to reserve only with the approval of the C.G. while Rule 58 contained no such restriction . There was also a slight difference in their wording ..... ” 17A(2 ) of the Act , this Court held as follows : “ Bo . Section 17-A(2 ) applies when an area is sought to be reserved by the State Government for undertaking mining operations exclusively through a Government company or corporation . When such area is notified the mineral or minerals in respect of which it is notified must also be stated . Such reservation can not be made without the approval of the Central Government ....... . 24 In State of T.N. v. M.P.P. Kavery Chetty ® , dealing with Section 33 . The High Court has placed reliance on a judgment of this Court delivered by a three - Judge Bench in Indian Charge Chrome ( supra ) . ( 1995 ) 2 SCC 402
