reserve any area not already held under any prospecting licence or mining lease for undertaking prospecting or mining operations through a government company or corporation owned or controlled by it , but , in terms of sub - section ( 2 ) of Section 17A ( supra ) where the Government proposes to do so , it shall by notification in the Official Gazette specify the boundaries of such area and the mineral or minerals in respect of which such areas will be reserved . Three distinct requirements emerge from Section 17-A(2 ) for a valid reservation viz . : ( i ) the reservation can only be with the approval of the Central Government and must confine to areas not already held under any prospecting licence or mining lease ; ( ii ) the reservation must be made by a notification in the Official Gazette ; and ( iii ) the notification must specify the boundaries of such areas and the mineral or minerals in respect of which such areas will be reserved . â€œ 19 . The upshot of the above discussion then is that while the State Government is the owner of the mineral deposits in the lands which vest in the Government as is the position in the case at hand , Parliament has by reason of the declaration made in Section 2 of the 1957 Act acquired complete dominion over the legislative field covered by the said legislation . The Act does not denude the State of the ownership of the minerals situate within its territories but there is no manner of doubt that it regulates to the extent set out in the provisions of the Act the development of mines and minerals in the country . It follows that if the State Government proposes to reserve any area for exploitation by the State - owned corporation or company , it must resort to making of such reservation in terms of Section 17-A with the approval of the Central Government and by a notification specifying boundaries of the area and mineral or minerals in respect of which such areas will be reserved . Inasmuch as the State Government has not so far issued any notification in terms of Section 17-A , the Industrial Policy , 2007 of the Kerala State Government does not have the effect of making a valid reservation within the comprehension of Section 31
