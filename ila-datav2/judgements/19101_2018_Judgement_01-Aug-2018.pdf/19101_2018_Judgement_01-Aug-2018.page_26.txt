Therefore , in the instant case when it is ‘ seniority - cum - suitability ’ , it implies that the senior most person , unless declared as unsuitable or unfit , was to be given appointment to the post in question . Therefore , according to him , the Tribunal has approached the issue in right perspective . For this purpose , he heavily relied upon paragraph Nos . 9 and 10 from the judgment of this Court in B.V. Sivaiah and Others v. K. Addanki Babu and Others ’ which read as under : “ 9 . The principle of “ merit - cum - seniority ” lays greater emphasis on merit and ability and seniority plays a less significant role . Seniority is to be given weight only when merit and ability are approximately equal . In the context of Rule 5(2 ) of the Indian Administrative Service / Indian Police Service ( Appointment by Promotion ) Regulations , 1955 which prescribed that “ selection for inclusion in such list shall be based on merit and suitability in all respects with due regard to seniority ’ Mathew , J. in Union of India v. Mohan Lal Capoor has said : ( SCC p. 856 , para 37 ) “ [ Flor inclusion in the list , merit and suitability in all respects should be the governing consideration and that seniority should play only a secondary role . It is only when merit and suitability are roughly equal that seniority will be a determining factor , or if it is not fairly possible to make an assessment inter se of the merit and suitability of two eligible candidates and come to a firm conclusion , seniority would tilt the scale . ” Similarly , Beg , J.
