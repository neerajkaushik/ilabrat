Army Staff . 38 ) As noted above , administrative instructions dated 10 " July , 1992 are issued by the Government of India , Ministry of Defence laying down the specific criteria for appointment to the post(s ) of DGMS . We have already reproduced the aforesaid criteria . However , since para ( i ) is the bone of contention , we reproduce the same hereinbelow for the sake of continuity of discussion : “ ( i ) The inter - se seniority and suitability of officers in the rank of Lt Gen ( and equivalent ) holding the posts of Comdt AMC Centre and School , Comdt AFMC , Pune and the Addl DG AFMS shall be assessed in the light of their earlier experience of serving in particular services and they shall be considered for appointment of DGs MS of services provided they have a minimum remainder service of six months from the date of occurrence of the vacancy . ” 39 ) The expression which is to be assigned its proper meaning is ‘ the inter se seniority and suitability ’ . Whereas the respondent argues that it is nothing but ‘ seniority - cum - suitability ’ which means senior most Lt . General subject to his suitability for the post of DGMS ( Army ) is to be appointed , the plea of the appellant is that the word ‘ inter se ’ has also to be given its due meaning and it is related both to seniority as well as suitability . On that basis , it is argued that suitability is to be judged ‘ inter se ’ between the eligible persons and one who is more suitable would be entitled to appoint as DGMS ( Army ) .
