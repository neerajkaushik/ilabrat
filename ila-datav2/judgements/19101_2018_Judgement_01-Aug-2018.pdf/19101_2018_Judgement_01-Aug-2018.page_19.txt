24 ) 25 ) the consultative process . According to him , this process of consultation / deliberation based on record falls in the realm of ‘ suitability ’ , and consequently , evaluation of worth and merit of an officer for being appointed to the post of DGMS . He also submitted that while the ‘ seniority ’ and ‘ residual service clause ’ provide a threshold limit or bar to determine the eligibility for consideration , the ‘ suitability ’ clause in the policy provides for procedure to be followed to assess fitness of the officer to hold the post based on his appointments held , ability to lead the AMC / Equiv in operations and _ challenging circumstances , organisational fitness for job ( appointment ) content , leadership qualities , competence , experience , knowledge , integrity and the like . Ultimately , the appointment to the post of DGMS is approved by exercising the executive powers of the President through the Central Government , which was followed in the present case . He also argued that when it comes to suitability of a person to man a particular post , it was to be considered by the appropriate authority and such considered opinion of the Competent Authority could not come within the purview of judicial review as held in Mahesh Chandra Gupta v. Union of India and Others in the 1 ( 2009 ) 8 SCC 273 Civil Appeal No . 5800 of 2018 Page 19 of 40
