find substance in the submission of the learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent that such a realisation dawned only after coming to know that the respondent was also in the reckoning for appointment to the post of DGMS ( Army ) and he was the senior most officer . ( iii ) The manner in which this Note is written leaves a reasonable impression that the exercise was done to exclude the respondent from appointment to the post of DGMS ( Army ) . In the first instance , though the criteria of assessment ‘ in the light of their earlier experience in a particular service ’ is mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Note , it nowhere reproduces the exact criteria , namely , ‘ inter se seniority and suitability ’ . Thus , while considering the earlier experience in a particular service , it was to be done in the light of inter se seniority - cum - suitability is not reflected in the said Note . In fact , there is no such exercise of inter se suitability undertaken in this Note . ( iv ) In paragraph 7 of the Note dated 23 " January 2018 , case of the respondent is discussed . Qua him it is mentioned that since he would be newly promoted from the rank of Major General , he does not have ‘ previous exposure to the working and environs of the IHQ of the MoD ’ . On that basis , he is proposed for appointment as DGHS ( AF ) instead of DGMS ( Army ) . This , Civil Appeal No . 5800 of 2018 Page 38 of 40
