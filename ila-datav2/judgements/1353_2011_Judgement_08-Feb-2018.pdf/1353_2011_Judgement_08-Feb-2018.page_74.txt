any entity controlled by the client is simultaneously entering any contra order elsewhere for the reason that in the online trading system , confidentiality of counter parties is ensured , is untenable . It was submitted by the Appellants that it was not possible for the broker to know who the counter party broker is and that trades were not synchronized but it was only a coincidence in some cases . Theoretically this is OK . But when parties decide to synchronize the transaction the story is different . There are many transactions giving an impression that these were all synchronized , otherwise there was no possibility of such perfect matching of quantity price etc . As the Respondent rightly stated it is too much of a coincidence over too long a period in too many transactions when both parties to the transaction had entered buy and sell orders for the same quantity of shares almost simultaneously . The data furnished in the show cause notice certainly goes to prove the synchronized nature of the transaction which is in violation of regulation 4 of the FUTP Regulations . The facts on record categorically establishes that BEB had indulged in synchronized trading in violation of regulation 47 of the FUTP Regulations . In a synchronized trading intention is implicit . " 25 . In the quasi - judicial proceeding before SEBI , the standard of proof is preponderance of probability . In a case of similar synchronized trading involving same set of brokers emphasizing that the standard of proof is " preponderance of probability " in paras ( 26 ) and ( 27 ) , in Kishore R. Ajmera case , this Court held as under : " 26 . It is a fundamental principle of law that proof of an allegation levelled against a person may be in the form of direct substantive evidence or , as in many cases , such proof may have to be inferred by a logical process of reasoning from the totality of the attending facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations / charges made and levelled . While direct evidence is a more certain basis to come to a conclusion , yet , in the absence thereof the Courts can not be helpless . It is the judicial duty to take note of the immediate and proximate _ facts_and circumstances surrounding the events on which the charges / allegations are founded and to reach what would appear to the Court to be a reasonable conclusion therefrom . The test_would _ always be that _ what_inferential_process_that_a reasonable / prudent_man would adopt to arrive at_a conclusion . " { underlining added ]          74
