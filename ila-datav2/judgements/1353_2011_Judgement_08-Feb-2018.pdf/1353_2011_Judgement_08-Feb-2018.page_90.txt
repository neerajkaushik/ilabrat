Conclusion:46 . Considering the reversal transactions , quantity , price and time and sale , parties being persistent in number of such trade transactions with huge price variations , it will be too naive to hold that the transactions are through screen - based trading and hence anonymous . Such conclusion would be over - looking the prior meeting of minds involving synchronization of buy and sell order and not negotiated deals as per the board 's circular . The impugned transactions are manipulative / deceptive device to create a desired loss and/or profit . Such synchronized trading is violative of transparent norms of trading in securities . If the findings of SAT are to be sustained , it would have serious repercussions undermining the integrity of the market and the impugned order of SAT is liable to be set aside . On the above additional reasonings also , | agree with the conclusion allowing the appeal preferred by SEBI against the traders . | also agree with the conclusion dismissing the appeal preferred by the SEBI against the brokers .
