traded on the exchange and it has contributed to 92.21 percent of the contracts traded in the Options segment during March 2007 . Further , the NIFTY options contracts contributed to 99.97 percent of the total Index Options contracts traded in March 2007 ( source : NSE website ) . In such a scenario it is seen that the noticee ’s counter party to all the trades in NIFTY contracts is Kasam Holding Pvt . Ltd. ( trading through the broker Vibrant Securities Private Limited ) , this clearly gives an indication to the existence of a pre - arrangement / synchronization / matched trades between the clients . Otherwise it does seem unrealistic that the orders should match exactly both quantity and price wise , just as a matter of coincidence , with the same party again and again . It is clear that there was an intention of creating a false or misleading appearance in the market and also that a manipulative /deceptive device was used for synchronization of trades . 24 . The trades executed by the noticee in all NIFTY contracts , matched with the counter party client , Kasam Holding Pvt . Ltd. in less than a few seconds . It is pertinent to note here that the noticee executed all the reversal trades in a matter of minutes / hours , at a profit of Rs.107.79 lakh without any _ significant change in the value of the underlying security . This raises doubts about the genuineness of the transactions . The fact that such transactions took place repeatedly over a period of time reinstates the fraudulent nature of such trades . ” 23
