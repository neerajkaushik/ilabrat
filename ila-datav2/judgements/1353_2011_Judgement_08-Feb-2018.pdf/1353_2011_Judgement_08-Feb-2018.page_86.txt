will not tolerate ‘ market abuse ’ and that the securities market abuse and that fraud , deceit artificiality , have no place in the securities market of the country and held as under : " 4 . India ’s capital market in the recent times has witnessed tremendous growth , characterised particularly by increasing participation of public . Investors ’ confidence in the capital market can be sustained largely by ensuring investors ’ protection . Disclosure and transparency are the two pillars on which market integrity rests . Facts of the case disclose how the investors ’ confidence has been eroded and how the market has been abused for personal gains and attainments . 11 . We would like to demonstrate on the facts of this case as well as law on the point that “ market abuse ” has now become a common practice in the Indian security market and , if not properly curbed , the same would result in defeating the very object and purpose of the SEBI Act which is intended to protect the interests of investors in securities and to promote the development of securities market . Capital market , as already stated , has witnessed tremendous growth in recent times , characterised particularly by the increasing participation of the public . Investor 's confidence in capital market can be sustained largely by ensuring investors ’ protection . 42 . SEBI , the market regulator , has to deal sternly with companies and their Directors indulging in manipulative and deceptive devices , insider trading , etc . or else they will be failing in their duty to promote orderly and healthy growth of the securities market . Economic offence , people of this country should know , is a serious crime which , if not properly dealt with , as it should be , will affect not only the country ’s economic growth , but also slow the inflow of foreign investment by genuine investors and also cast a slur on India ’s securities market . Message should go that our country will not tolerate “ market abuse ” and that we are governed by the “ rule of law ’ . Fraud , deceit , artificiality , SEBI should ensure , have no place in the securities market of this country and “ market security ” is our motto . People with power and money and in management of the companies , unfortunately often command more respect in our society than the subscribers and investors in their companies . Companies are thriving with investors ’ contributions but they are a divided lot . SEBI has , therefore , a duty to protect _ investors ,        86
