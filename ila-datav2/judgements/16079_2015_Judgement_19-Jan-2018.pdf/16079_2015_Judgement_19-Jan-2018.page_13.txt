13 vehicle . However , this Court held that even if the insurer succeeds in establishing its defence , the Tribunal or the Court can direct the insurance company to pay the award amount to the claimant(s ) and , in turn , recover the same from the owner of the vehicle . The three - Judge Bench , after analysing the earlier decisions on the point , held that there was no reason to deviate from the said well - settled principle . In paragraph 107 , the Court then observed thus : “ We may , however , hasten to add that the Tribunal and the court must , however , exercise their jurisdiction to issue such a direction upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of each case and in the event such a direction has been issued , despite arriving at a finding of fact to the effect that the insurer has been able to establish that the insured has committed a breach of contract of insurance as envisaged under sub - clause ( ii ) of clause ( a ) of sub - section ( 2 ) of Section 149 of the Act , the insurance company shall be entitled to realize the awarded amount from the owner or driver of the vehicle , as the case may be , in execution of the same award having regard to the provisions of Sections 165 and 168 of the Act . However , in the event , having regard to the limited scope of inquiry in the proceedings before the Tribunal it has not been able to do so , the insurance company may initiate a separate action therefor against the owner or the driver of the vehicle or both , as the case may be . Those exceptional cases may arise when the evidence becomes available to or comes to the notice of the insurer at a subsequent stage or for one reason or the other , the insurer was not given an opportunity to defend at all . Such a course of action may also be resorted to when a fraud or collusion between the victim and the owner of the vehicle is detected or comes to the knowledge of the insurer at a later stage . ”
