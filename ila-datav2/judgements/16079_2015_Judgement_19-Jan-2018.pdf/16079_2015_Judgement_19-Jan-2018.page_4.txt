4 could be no presumption that Joginder Singh was driving the offending vehicle . The appellants have assailed the aforesaid view taken by the Tribunal and affirmed by the High Court . 5 . According to the appellants , the Insurance Company did not produce any evidence before the Tribunal . As a result , it was not open to the respondent No.2 Insurance Company to extricate itself from the liability , having duly insured the offending vehicle DIL-5955 , which fact has been substantiated by production of the Insurance Policy . A defence being available to the Insurance Company , that the offending vehicle was not driven by an authorised person and/or person not having a valid driving licence , it was obligatory on the part of the Insurance Company to substantiate that defence and more so , to rebut the plea taken by the owner of the offending vehicle that the offending vehicle was being driven by an authorised person having a valid driving licence . To buttress this argument , reliance has been placed on the decision of this Court in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs . Swarn Singh and Ors . â€™ 1 ( 2004 ) 3 SCC 297
