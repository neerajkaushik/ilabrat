property . Consequently , he had entered into an agreement of sale with Sagi Subba Raju , as far back as on 19.09.1974 . The suit was filed in the year 1978 , which was later transferred to another Court and the same was re - numbered as O.S. No . 72 of 1983 . Since 1978 , this litigation is being fought by the prospective vendee . The property of about three and half acres was agreed to be sold by Veeraswamy in favour of the prospective vendee in the year 1974 for a sum of Rs.51,000/. Such price was agreed to between the vendor as well as the prospective vendee . This Court can not imagine the value of the property as it stood in the year 1974 in the said area , i.e. at Bhimavaram village in Andhra Pradesh . Be that as it may , we find that hardship was neither pleaded nor proved by the appellants herein before the trial Court . No issue was raised relating to hardship before the trial Court . A plea which was not urged before the trial Court can not be allowed to be raised for the first time before the appellate Courts . Moreover , mere escalation of price is no ground for interference at this stage ( see the judgment of this Court in the case of Narinderjit Singh vs. North Star Estate Promoters Limited , ( 2012 ) 5 SCC 712 ) . Added to it , as mentioned supra , the appellants do not have the locus standi to question the judgment 9
