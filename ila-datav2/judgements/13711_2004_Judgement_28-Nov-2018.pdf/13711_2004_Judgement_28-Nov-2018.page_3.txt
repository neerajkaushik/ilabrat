( suit for specific performance ) was decreed partly , directing sale of 1/3 " of the property in favour of the plaintiff Sagi Subba Raju , and such decree was confirmed by the first appellate Court . Feeling aggrieved by these judgments and decrees , the unsuccessful appellants filed appeals before the High Court . So also , Sagi Subba Raju , who was to get 1/3 " of the property in the suit for specific performance filed L.P.A. No . 323 of 1992 before the High Court . All these appeals were heard together by the High Court and decided against the appellants herein , which means that the judgments and decrees of dismissal passed in O.S. Nos . 97 & 98 of 1984 were confirmed by the Division Bench of the High Court also . Thus , there are concurrent findings of three Courts in respect of those two suits filed by appellants for partition against the appellants herein . In respect of O.S. No . 72 of 1983 also , the Division Bench proceeded to grant a decree , as prayed for , in favour of Sagi Subba Raju and against the appellants herein . In other words , the suit for specific performance also was decreed fully against the appellants herein . Hence , the appellants are before this Court . 3 . Shri A.
