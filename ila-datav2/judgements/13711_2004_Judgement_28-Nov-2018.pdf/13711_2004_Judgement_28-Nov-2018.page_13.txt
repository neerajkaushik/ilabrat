two Wills are proved , and thus Veeraswamy being the beneficiary under the two Wills had become the absolute owner of the suit properties in question . Such decree has attained finality in favour of the defendants who are either deleted or dead and whose legal representatives have not been brought on record . In case these appeals are allowed in respect of the other defendants , the decree to be passed by this Court in these appeals would definitely conflict with the decree already passed in favour of the other defendants . As mentioned supra , the Court can not be called upon to make two inconsistent decrees about the same subject matter . In order to avoid conflicting decrees , the Court has no alternative but to dismiss the appeals in their entirety ( see the judgment of this Court in the case of Shahazada Bi vs. Halimabi , ( 2004 ) 7 SCC 354 ) . 10 . In view of the above , the appeals fail not only on the ground of non - maintainability , but also on merits , and are dismissed .
