18 . Before parting with the case , we may repeat with profit that it is not an appeal for cancellation of bail as the cancellation is not sought because of supervening circumstances . The annulment of the order passed by the High Court is sought as many relevant factors have not been taken into consideration which includes the criminal antecedents of the accused and that makes the order a deviant one . Therefore , the inevitable result is the lancination of the impugned order [ Budhpal v. State of U.P. , 2014 SCC OnLine All 14815 ] . ” ( ii ) | Prasanta Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee & Anr . ? “ 9 . We are of the opinion that the impugned order is clearly unsustainable . It is trite that this Court does not , normally , interfere with an order passed by the High Court granting or rejecting bail to the accused . However , it is equally incumbent upon the High Court to exercise its discretion judiciously , cautiously and strictly in compliance with the basic principles laid down in a plethora of decisions of this Court on the point . It is well settled that , among other circumstances , the factors to be borne in mind while considering an application for bail are : ( i ) whether there is any prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence ; ( ii ) | nature and gravity of the accusation ; ( iii ) severity of the punishment in the event of conviction ; ( iv ) danger of the accused absconding or fleeing , if released on bail ; ( v ) character , behaviour , means , position and standing of the accused ; ( vi ) likelihood of the offence being repeated ; ( vii ) reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being influenced ; and ( viii ) danger , of course , of justice being thwarted by grant of bail . 2 ( 2010 ) 14 SCC 496 Criminal Appeal No . 569 of 2018 & Anr . @ SLP ( Crl . ) No . 5611 of 2017 & Anr .
