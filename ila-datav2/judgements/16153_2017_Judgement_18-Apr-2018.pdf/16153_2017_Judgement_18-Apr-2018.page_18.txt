They must learn to maintain fine balance between the personal liberty and the social interests . 121 . The performance of the judicial officers must be periodically evaluated on the basis of the cases decided by them . In case , they have not been able to maintain balance between personal liberty and societal interests , the lacunae must be pointed out to them and they may be asked to take corrective measures in future . Ultimately , the entire discretion of grant or refusal of bail has to be left to the judicial officers and all concerned must ensure that grant or refusal of bail is considered basically on the facts and circumstances of each case . 122 . In our considered view , the Constitution Bench in Sibbia case [ ( 1980 ) 2 SCC 565 : 1980 SCC ( Cri ) 465 ] has comprehensively dealt with almost all aspects of the concept of anticipatory bail under Section 438 CrPC . A number of judgments have been referred to by the learned counsel for the parties consisting of Benches of smaller strength where the Courts have observed that the anticipatory bail should be of limited duration only and ordinarily on expiry of that duration or standard duration , the court granting the anticipatory bail should leave it to the regular court to deal with the matter . This view is clearly contrary to the view taken by the Constitution Bench in Sibbia case [ ( 1980 ) 2 SCC 565 : 1980 SCC ( Cri ) 465 ] . In the preceding para , it is clearly spelt out that no limitation has been envisaged by the legislature under Section 438 CrPC . The Constitution Bench has aptly observed that “ we see no valid reason for rewriting Section 438 with a view , not to expanding the scope and ambit of the discretion conferred on the High Court or the Court of Session but , for the purpose of limiting it ” . 123 . In view of the clear declaration of law laid down by the Constitution Bench in Sibbia case [ ( 1980 ) 2 SCC 565 : 1980 SCC ( Cri ) 465 ] , it would not be proper to limit the life of anticipatory bail . When the Court observed that the anticipatory bail is for limited duration and thereafter the accused should apply to the regular court for bail , that means the life of Section 438 CrPC would come to an end after that limited duration . This limitation has not been Criminal Appeal No . 569 of 2018 & Anr . @ SLP ( Crl . ) No . 5611 of 2017 & Anr . Page 18 of 23
