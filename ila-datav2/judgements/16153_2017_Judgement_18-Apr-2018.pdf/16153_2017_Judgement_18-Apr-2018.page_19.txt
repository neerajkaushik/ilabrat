envisaged by the legislature . The Constitution Bench in Sibbia case [ ( 1980 ) 2 SCC 565 : 1980 SCC ( Cri ) 465 ] clearly observed that it is not necessary to rewrite Section 438 CrPC . Therefore , in view of the clear declaration of the law by the Constitution Bench , the life of the order under Section 438 CrPC granting bail can not be curtailed . 124 . The ratio of the judgment of the Constitution Bench in Sibbia case [ ( 1980 ) 2 SCC 565 : 1980 SCC ( Cri ) 465 ] perhaps was not brought to the notice of Their Lordships who had decided the cases of Salauddin Abdulsamad Shaikh v. State of Maharashtra [ ( 1996 ) 1 SCC 667 : 1996 SCC ( Cri ) 198 ] , K.L. Verma v. State [ ( 1998 ) 9 SCC 348 : 1998 SCC ( Cri ) 1031 ] , Adri Dharan Das v. State of W.B. [ ( 2005 ) 4 SCC 303 : 2005 SCC ( Cri ) 933 ] and Sunita Devi v. State of Bihar [ ( 2005 ) 1 SCC 608 : 2005 SCC ( Cri ) 435 ] . ‚Äù 13 ) We have deliberated on the respective arguments in conjunction with the record of the case . Since we are concerned with the order of the High Court whereby respondent No . 2 has been granted bail , having regard to the limited scope of interference with such an order and keeping in mind the parameters on which such an order can be interdicted , we are of the view that the reasons given by the High Court to grant bail to respondent No . 2 , can not be termed as perverse . It can be discerned from the reading of the impugned order , from which we have culled out circumstances , that the High Court kept in mind the relevant factors while considering the bail application . No doubt , the offence with which respondent No . 2 is charged is a serious one . Criminal Appeal No . 569 of 2018 & Anr . @ SLP ( Crl . ) No . 5611 of 2017 & Anr . Page 19 of 23
