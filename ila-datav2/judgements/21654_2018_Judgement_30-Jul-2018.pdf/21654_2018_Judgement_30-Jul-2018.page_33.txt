live under a legal system which aims to protect their interests and preserve their rights . Therefore , when the court molds the relief by granting ‘ compensation ’ in proceedings under Articles 32 or 226 of the Constitution seeking enforcement or protection of fundamental rights , it does so under the public law by way of penalising the wrongdoer and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the State which has failed in its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen . The payment of compensation in such cases is not to be understood , as it is generally understood in a civil action for damages under the private law but in the broader sense of providing relief by an order of making ‘ monetary amends ’ under the public law for the wrong done due to breach of public ’ duty , of not protecting the fundamental rights of the citizen . The compensation is in the nature of ‘ exemplary damages ’ awarded against the wrong doer for the breach of its public law duty 33
