judgment , to come to the conclusion that the terms of such schemes must be strictly followed , and the contract can not be varied . We may add here that apparently there are certain observations in paras 33 and 34 of the impugned order , which may also run contrary to clause 5(1 ) of the SVRS-2004 Scheme , insofar as the Division Bench has opined that the words “ whichever is less ” have been excluded from clause 5 of the SVRS-2004 Scheme . It may be noted that such is not the case , for clause 5 of the SVRS-2004 Scheme , as extracted above , explicitly provides , in clause 5(1 ) , that an employee seeking special voluntary retirement , under the Scheme shall be entitled to the lower of the ex - gratia amounts as mentioned thereunder . We feel it suffice to clarify that what is binding between the parties is the statutory scheme itself , as per its terms . 20 . We have , thus , no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that statutory or contractual , such voluntary retirement schemes as the SVRS2004 Scheme have to be strictly adhered to , and the very objective of having such Schemes would be defeated , if parts of other Schemes are sought to be imported into such voluntary retirement schemes . What is offered by the employer is a package as contained in the Schemes of voluntary retirement , and that alone would be admissible . 14
