DW-3 . In his evidence he stated that the sale deed was executed by Dharam Singh after he had explained to the parties about contents of the said deed . Ex . D-1 was attested by PW-2 and PW-3 . They have nowhere stated in their statements that Dharam Singh was not in good state of mind at the time of the execution of the document . Though it is contended on behalf of the appellant that Dharam Singh was not keeping well , no medical evidence has been produced in support of the said contention . We do not find any ground to interfere with the judgment of the High Court . Sy Consequently , the appeal is dismissed , with no orders as to costs . cence ccc ceescccceesesscsceeseeeee J. ( N.V.
