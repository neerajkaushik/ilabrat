10 Code of Civil Procedure , 1908 of the principal Court of original jurisdiction within the local limits whereof the award or the interim award has been made and shall be executed accordingly . 22 . Overriding effect of this Act . Notwithstanding any thing contained in any other Law , Rule , Order , Scheme , or Contract Agreement entered into before or = after commencement of this Act , any dispute as defined in Section 2(e ) of this Act shall be regulated under the provisions of this Act , Rules and Regulations framed thereunder , and absence of arbitration clause in any contract agreement shall not have effect excluding any dispute from the purview of this Act . ” ( 4 ) It is not in dispute that the parties have executed agreement dated 22 ™ June , 2012 , providing for appointment of an arbitrator as per _ provisions of the Central Act . Relevant portion of Clause 25 of the said Agreement is as follows : “ The arbitration shall be conducted ’ in accordance with provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act , 1996 ( 26 of 1996 ) or any statutory modification or re - enactment thereof and the rules made there under and for the time being in force shall apply to the arbitration proceeding under the clause . ” ( 5 ) The scheme of Sections 8 , 9 and 22 of the State Act shows that in the absence of an agreement ’ stipulating ’ the applicability of the Central Act , the State Act applies to works contracts . Since in the present cases , an arbitration agreement exists and stipulates applicability of the Central Act , the State Act will not apply . We , thus , do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned order .
