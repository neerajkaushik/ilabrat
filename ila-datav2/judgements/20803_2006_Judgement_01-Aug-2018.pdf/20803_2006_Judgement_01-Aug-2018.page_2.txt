our notice that the Metropolitan Magistrate concerned resigned from service shortly after the alleged incident . 4 . When the matter was posted before the High Court , the appellant was asked by the Court as to whether he wanted to submit anything in writing and , accordingly , he filed a detailed affidavit . We do not propose to go into the narration of facts or the defence taken by the appellant , since , in our view , it is not necessary to go into the same . 5 . Having regard to the defence taken by the appellant , the High Court ought to have conducted an inquiry . That having not been done and _ the punishment having been imposed solely on the basis of the reference made by the District Judge and the affidavit in response , we are of the view that the principles of natural justice have not been complied with fully . All that apart , we also find that having been asked as to whether he had anything to say on the sentence , the appellant had tendered unconditional apology 6 . In view of the above circumstances , the apology tendered by the appellant is taken on record , we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed upon the appellant and the appeal is allowed .
