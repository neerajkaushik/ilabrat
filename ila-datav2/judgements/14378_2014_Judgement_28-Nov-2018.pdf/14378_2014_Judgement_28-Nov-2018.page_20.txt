through aggravating and mitigating circumstances came up for consideration in Swamy Shraddananda ( 2)v . State of Karnataka . On a review , it was concluded in para 48 of the Report that there is a lack of evenness in the sentencing process . The rarest _ of rare principle has not been followed uniformly or consistently . Reference in this context was made to Aloke Nath Duttav . State of WB . which in turn referred to several earlier decisions to bring home the point .      31 . The critique in Swamy Shraddananda was mentioned ( with approval ) in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra while sharing this Court 's “ unease and sense of disquiet ” in paras 109 , 129 and 130 of the Report . In fact , in para 109 of the Report , it was observed that : ( Bariyar case ) “ 109 . ... the balance sheet of aggravating and _ mitigating circumstances approach invoked on a case - by - case basis has not worked sufficiently well so as to remove the vice of arbitrariness from our capital sentencing system . It can be safely said that the Bachan Singh threshold _ of ‘ the rarest _ of rare cases ’ has been most variedly and inconsistently applied by the various High Courts as also this Court . ”                32 . It does appear that in view of the inherent multitude of possibilities , the aggravating and mitigating circumstances approach has not been effectively implemented . 33 . Therefore , in our respectful opinion , not only does the aggravating and mitigating circumstances approach need _ a fresh look but the necessity of adopting this approach also needs a fresh look in light of the conclusions in Bachan Singh . \t_appears to us that even though Bachan              Singh intended “ principled sentencing ” , sentencing has now really become Judge - centric as highlighted in Swamy    20
