APPELLANT(S ) Versus THE STATE OF CHHATTISGARH ... RESPONDENT{(S ) JUDGMENT Deepak Gupta , J. 1 . We have had the privilege of going through the erudite judgment delivered by our learned brother Justice Kurian Joseph . We are in full agreement with all that is stated in the judgment except the following observations in Para 23 : “ Having regard also to the said Report of the Law Commission that the constitutional regulation of capital punishment attempted in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab , ( 1980 ) 2 SCC 684 , has failed to prevent death sentences from being “ arbitrarily and freakishly imposed ” and that capital punishment has failed to achieve any constitutionally valid penological goals , we are of the view that a time has come where we view the need for death penalty as a punishment , especially its purpose and practice . ” 30
