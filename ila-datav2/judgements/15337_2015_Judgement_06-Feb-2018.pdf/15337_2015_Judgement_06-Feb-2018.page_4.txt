On the two issues that were raised before the State Commission , the Appellate Tribunal found in favour of Respondent No.1 and was in complete agreement with the findings of the State Commission . However , the Appellate Tribunal then went on to advert to an affidavit that was filed before the Appellate Tribunal seeking to bring on record certain subsequent events as being material for decision of the appeal . And these subsequent events were sought to be brought on record by the appellant itself . After a contest on whether these events ought to be brought on record , Respondent No.1 stating that this is a new case not permissible in appeal , the Appellate Tribunal turned down the plea of Respondent No.1 and felt that it was important to examine the subsequent events on merits . It then referred to certain provisions of the PPA and , in particular , Clause 9.3.2 which deals with termination for default of Respondent No.1 , and then went on to hold as follows : â€œ 12.12 . Thus , for termination of the PPA , in the event of payment default for a continuous period of three months , the appellant has to deliver a Default Notice to the second respondent in writing
