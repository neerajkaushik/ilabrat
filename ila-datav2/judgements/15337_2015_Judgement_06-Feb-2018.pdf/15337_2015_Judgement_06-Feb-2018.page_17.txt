substance of the notice . 20 ) Similarly , in Thakur Pratap Singh vs. Shri Krishna Gupta and Others , [ 1955 ] 2 S.C.R. 1029 , this Court dealt with the filling up of a nomination paper in order to stand for the office of President of a Municipal Committee . Here again , this Court held that the fact that the word “ occupation ” in the form was either struck out or left blank would make no difference since a man ’s occupation is not one of the qualifications for the office of President . It was , therefore , held that this part of the form was only directory , and is part of the description of the candidate , but does not go to the root of the matter , so long as there is enough material in the paper to enable him to be identified beyond doubt . This judgment again is wholly distinguishable on facts in that , as has been found by us above , the part of Clause 9.3.2 relating to calling upon Respondent No.1 to remedy defaults within a period of 30 days unless otherwise agreed is as important as the events of default that have been stated to have taken place . Substantial compliance , therefore , can be no answer to such a mandatory requirement .
