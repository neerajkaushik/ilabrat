2 instruction as to whether there are any vacancies available , either as Work Charged Clerk or Carpenter . Today , on instruction , Sh . Raval submits that there is no vacancy available as of now . It is also explained that one junior happened to be retained in service pursuant to the directions issued by the High Court in the facts of that case . Be that as it may , we find that the workmen had around five years of service and , therefore , compensation awarded to them to the tune of Rs . 1,85,000/- ( Rupees One Lakh and Eighty Five Thousand ) seems to be on the lower side . Having regard to the entire facts and circumstances of the case , particularly the prolonged litigation pursued by the parties reaching upto this Court , we are of the view that the interest of justice would be met if the compensation is fixed at Rs . 6,50,000/(Rupees Six Lakhs and Fifty Thousand ) each , in addition to the amounts already paid , in full and final settlement of the entire claims of the appellants . The appeals are allowed to the above extent . 4 . We make it clear that in the case of Sh . Karshanbhai Ramjibhai Jaladiya ( appellant in Civil Appeal No . 2949/2018 ) , he shall be entitled to preferential appointment in case any future vacancy arises , either as Work Charged Clerk or as Carpenter ,
